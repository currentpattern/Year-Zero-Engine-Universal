You may perform more actions than limited here (except for MOVE), but every FAST ACTION over the limit adds a -1 penalty and every SLOW ACTION over the limit adds a -2 penalty. Some Talents may increase this limit. This penalty is cumulative for the round and resets to 0 when your turn ends.

Ex. _A character can DODGE (fast) as a reaction, then on their turn RUN (fast action), SHOVE (fast action -1), and ATTACK (slow action -3). 

Ex. _A character SLASHES (slow action), SLASHES again (slow action -2), RETREATS (fast action, no penalty because this fast action remains within the "1 slow, 1 fast" action economy)._

_Ex. A character RUNS twice (2 fast), ATTACKS (slow -2), ATTACKS again (slow, -4), then DISARMS (fast, -5)_

_Ex. A Character DODGES (fast) as a reaction, then on their turn RUNS twice (2 fast (accumulating a -1)), ATTACKS (slow -3), ATTACKS again (slow, -5), then DISARMS (fast, -6). Doable for a character with very high skills!_
