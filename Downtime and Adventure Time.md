## Downtime System

## Core Concept
- Players decide how many days of downtime they want to pass
- Each day provides a set number of downtime points
- Downtime Activities have a base cost in points
## Point Allocation
- 3 downtime points per day
- This represents the usable time after sleep and regular work
## Activity Costs (per day)
- Fulltime Day job: 2 points
- Skill/Talent training: 1 point
- Information gathering: 1-2 points
- Side gig/project: 1-2 point
- Rest/Relaxation: 1 point, gives a +2 to a downtime roll next day
## Implementation
1. Ask players how many days they want to skip
2. Multiply days by 2 to get total downtime points
3. Players allocate points to activities
4. Resolve activities with single rolls or narrative description
## Example
Players want to skip 3 days:
- Total points: 3 days × 3 points/day = 9 points
- Player could choose:
    - 3 days with day job (6 points)
    - 2 days with Rest/Relaxation (+2 points)
    - 1 day with skill training (1 points)
    - 1 day of information gathering (1 point)
## Is it Downtime or Adventure Time?
Use this flowchart to determine whether an activity should be treated as downtime or adventure time:
**Downtime Activities:** Routine, low stakes, predictable outcomes, solo-focused
	**Adventure Activities:** potentially impactful on relationships/world, failure could lead to serious consequences, involve multiple PCs working together

1. **Narrative Weight:** Does the activity involve significant consequences for the character, group, or plot?
- **Yes → Adventure Time** (Activities that could alter relationships, introduce new plot threads, or significantly impact the world)
- **No → Downtime** (Activities that are routine, low-stakes, or primarily about personal development)
    
1. **Risk Level:** Is there substantial risk involved where failure could lead to danger, harm, or major setbacks?
- **Yes → Adventure Time** (Activities where failure could lead to serious consequences (physical, social, or financial))
- **No → Downtime** (Activities with low risk or predictable outcomes)

1. **Player Engagement:** Does the activity involve multiple players working together or opportunities for detailed roleplay?
- **Yes → Adventure Time** (Activities that involve multiple players working together or require detailed decision-making)
- **No → Downtime** ( Activities that are solo-focused and don’t require much input from other players)
    
If any of these questions lean toward "Adventure Time," treat it as such.
## Transitioning Between Downtime and Adventure Time
Sometimes an activity starts as downtime but escalates into adventure time due to unexpected developments. Here’s how to handle those transitions:
1. Gm may roll for complications during downtime activities:
    - Example: During routine information gathering, the PC attracts unwanted attention from a rival gang.
    - If complications arise, pause downtime resolution and transition into adventure time.

2. GM may use encounter rolls to inject dynamic events:
    - Example: While on a routine side hustle, the PC encounters an NPC tied to the main plot.
    - Shift focus to roleplay or tactical play as needed.
        
3. Player may "opt-in" to Adventure Time:
    - If they want more detail or drama in what would otherwise be downtime (e.g., roleplaying through every step of their burglary), let them take control of the pacing.
