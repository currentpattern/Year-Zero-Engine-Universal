CHASE OBSTACLE EFFECTS

FOOT


SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS
 The prey must roll Persuasion (no action) to convince them to move. Success gives a +2 modifier to any Hide maneuver. A failed roll means that the prey’s maneuver fails automatically. (a crowd that can be persuaded, monks)
−2 modifier to Pursue/Flee, Hide and Stand and Shoot. Anyone who performs the Stand and Shoot maneuver will be attacked. (guards/police blocking the chase)
D6 hostiles block.  Prey must roll Persuasion (no action) to be allowed to pass. A failed roll means that the hostiles attack – the chosen maneuver fails automatically and one hostile attacks in close combat. If the Persuasion roll succeeds, the hostiles will attack the pursuer instead. (street thugs)
