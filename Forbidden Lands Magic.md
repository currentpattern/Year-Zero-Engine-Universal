### **LEARNING MAGIC**

To learn a new discipline, or increase your rank in a discipline you already know, you should find a master with a higher rank than you in the magic talent and who is ready to share their secrets with you. This can require both persuasion and substantial compensa- tion. Without a teacher, the cost in XP for increasing the rank in a magical talent or learning a new one is tripled. Read more about spending XP here.

There are far more spells possible than are commonly known. There are a few ways of learning these unknown spells for each magical path. Some teachers may know secret techniques, rare grimoires may contain secret spells, one may uncover spells from personal research and experimentation, and some say the Gods occasionally grant new powers as boons.

**From A Teacher**  
A character may learn secret spells at the same time as they increase a magic path if taught by a teacher. No rolls are required.  
**From A Grimoire**  
These are often hard to understand, as every spellcaster writes in their own way. Each spell requires you to spend a Willpower Point and successfully roll against Lore (if sorcery) or Insight (if druidic magic) with a penalty equal to the spell level. On a failure you suffer a magic mishap, if the spell is higher than your rank you also suffer a magic mishap, and if you push the roll you suffer a magic mishap. These add together, read the new magic mishaps table. If you fail, you may try again the next Quarter day.  
**From Experiments in Magic**  
First, discovering a secret spell requires a PL 4 Sense Magic casting, 5 Silver worth of materials per spell Rank, 1D8 days of study (2 quarter days per day), and one Lore (for sorcery), Insight (for druidry) success per spell Rank you’re investigating.  
After discovering the spell, learning it on your own: This works just like learning from a grimoire (1 WP, 1 Lore/Insight X per spell rank, mishaps), but also requires assorted herbs and materials worth at least 5 silver per spell rank and these materials must include the ingredient component of the spell. Also, an extra mishap always happens.

**LEARNING A MAGIC PATH FROM SCRATCH**  
In order to gain Rank 1 in a new magical path, you must first find a teacher, and take their initiation into the mysteries of that path. You must spend 5XP, and succeed at a WITS roll.

From this point on, you have only a rudimentary connection to the magical path. Choose **one** rank 1 spell. To gain another rank 1 spell, you must spend 1/4 day practicing, and succeed at a WITS roll. Once you’ve gained all (General and Path) rank 1 spells, further advancement continues as normal: rank 2 immediately confers all rank 2 spells.

**DISCOVERING ENTIRELY NEW MAGIC SCHOOLS FROM SCRATCH**  
There are 2 steps to this:  
1) Discover that the school exists and what its initiation process and magical nature is. This is the same process as discovering a secret spell from experiments in magic. See above.  
2) Self-initiate into the school. Once you’ve discovered the initiation process, carry it out. Spend 15 XP (45 XP for any profession other than Sorcerer/Druid). Succeed on a Lore or Insight roll (-1 penalty). Succeed on a WITS roll. 2 ranks of magic mishap are guaranteed to occur. You may push any roll, but 1 more rank of mishap is accrued per push. If successful, the PC changes their Profession to Druid/Sorcerer. You also gain 1 Rank 1 spell of this school, To learn more spells, you must 1) discover them individually (see above rules), 2) Learn them individually (see above rules).

### **SPELLS**

Your attempts to use magic to impose your will on the world are called spells. A large number of spells are described later in this chapter. More will be published in upcoming supplements for the game, and you can also write your own spells under the watchful eye of your GM.

**SPELL RANKS**  
All spells in this chapter are rated in ranks ranging from 1 to 3. There can be spells of even higher rank. As a magic user, you can cast all spells that are at a rank equal to or lower than your rank in the related magical talent. For ex- ample, if you have rank 2 in the PATH OF BLOOD talent, you can cast all spells at rank 1 and 2 in the Blood Magic discipline.

CHANCE CASTING: If you really want to, you can cast a spell at one rank above the rank of your magical talent. However, this comes at a great risk, as you will automatically suffer a random magic mishap in this case. You can never cast a spell that is two ranks or more above your talent rank.

**CASTING A SPELL**  
Casting a spell is generally a slow action in com- bat, but there are also so-called power words that are fast actions. Another type of spell are ritu- als that take a longer time to cast (see the boxed text on the next page). Whether or not a spell is a power word or ritual is detailed under each spell.

Casting a spell requires a great deal of men- tal exertion and requires that you spend one or more Willpower Points. You accumulate WP by pushing dice rolls. The more WP you spend, the more powerful the effect of the spell is.

POWER LEVEL: The number of Willpower Points you spend when you cast a spell is called its base Power Level. Dice rolls and other fac- tors can further modify the Power Level.

ROLLING DICE: Unlike skills, you can never fail at casting a spell. Instead, you roll a num- ber of Base Dice equal to the number of Will- power Points you spend. If you roll one or sev- eral X, the spell is overcharged, and if you roll one or several BANES you suffer some sort of magic mishap. You cannot push this roll.

OVERCHARGING: When you cast a spell, every X you roll increases its Power Level by one. For example, if you spend 2 WP to cast a spell and roll two X, its Power Level is increased to 4.

MAGIC MISHAP: If you roll one or several BANES when you cast a spell, you have unleashed pow- erful forces but are unable to control them and you suffer a magic mishap.

Every BANE/SKULL rolled is 1 mishap point, and triggers a D66 roll on the Magical Mishap table (for GM’s eyes only).  
1 Mishap point: -10 from rolled result  
2 Mishap points: result as-is  
3 Mishap points: +10 to rolled result.  
+ 10 to rolled result for every extra Mishap point.

SAFE CASTING: If you cast a spell at a lower rank than your talent rank for the discipline, you may opt to roll one less die for every point of differ- ence. This reduces the risk of a magic mishap, but also makes the spell less likely to overcharge. If the result is zero dice or less, don’t roll at all – the spell simply works as intended.

RANGE: Every spell has a range, which denotes the maximum distance at which it can be cast. The range PERSONAL means the spell only af- fects yourself.

DURATION: Every spell has a duration. Imme- diate means that the effect is instantaneous and does not last. A Quarter Day is Morning, Day, Evening, or Night. Read more about Quarter Days in the next chapter.

WILLPOWER POINTS: Casting a spell requires at least one Willpower Point. This applies even if it does not explicitly say so in the description of the spell.

INGREDIENTS: Most spells list ingredients or objects that can be used to cast the spell with greater effect. If you use the right ingredients, the Power Level of the spell increases by one. You must still spend at least one Willpower Point to cast the spell. Once the spell is cast, the ingredient has been spent and cannot be used again to cast spells.

RITUALS: Some complicated spells can’t be cast as an action in combat, as they require more time and preparation. A typical ritual takes a Quarter Day to perform. Rituals often have other prerequisites, aside from optional ingredients, that must be used to perform the ritual.

GRIMOIRES: You don’t need your spells written down to cast them, but it makes it easier to get it right. Grimoires are highly sought-after artifacts among sorcerers. If you cast a spell from a book or a scroll, its rank is considered one step lower than usual. In combat, you must spend a fast action readying your grimoire before you can cast the spell.  
  Writing down a spell re- quires you to first cast it once (chance casting doesn’t count). Then, you must spend a Quar- ter Day with quill in hand and make a LORE roll. Writing down a ritual takes two Quarter Days.

### **MAGICAL TECHNIQUES**  
Beside the standard method of an individual performing rituals or casting spells, there are a couple other means by which magic-users can increase the effectiveness of their magic.

**Ritual Sacrifice**  
Ritualistic sacrifices of conscious intelligent beings act as incredibly potent lure of dark horrors beyond the veil of reality, which help the sorcerer to achieve whatever blasphemous goal has in her perverted mind. In terms of game mechanics, a ritual sacrifice doubles the WILLPOWER points spent by the sorcerer (double, + 1 for BLOOD MAGIC and DEATH MAGIC). This means that the base Power Level is doubled (and + 1 for BLOOD & DEATH MAGIC), and the sorcerer must roll double the dice (+ 1 for BLOOD & DEATH MAGIC) to determine if the spell is overcharged or a magic mishap occurs. The sacrifice must happen on the same turn as the spell is cast, and it requires a FAST action to perform the sacrifice itself. The sacrifice must be prepared in advanced; most likely needing minions to ensure the ritual is uninterrupted and the sacrifice about to be offered don’t fight back. A good rule of thumb is a few hours to prepare the ritual and one full turn of chants/gestures per spell rank just before the sacrifice.

**Cabals**  
Several sorcerers with aligned interest can join forces and sign a pact before their gods and the magical void beyond our world. Creating a Cabal requires each member to cast a Power Level 1 MAGICAL SEAL. Cabals can share their WILLPOWER points when cast- ing spells, supporting each other with strange rites and murmuring forgotten psalms. However, their souls are joined by a strange and powerful magic beyond their control, and therefore if any of the members of the ca- bal is BROKEN, all other members, no matter their location, will suffer an attack to their WITS with 10 base dice and damage equal to the amount of sorcerers in the Cabal. There is not theoretical limit to how many sorcerers can collaborate in this way. If one wants to end their Cabal, each member must cast a Power Level 5 DISPEL MAGIC. If even one member fails to cast, the Cabal remains.

**MAGICAL SEAL**  
RANK 1  
RANGE: Arm’s Length  
DURATION: Quarter Day  
INGREDIENT: Piece of chalk  
Using this spell, you protect a person or a lo- cation (no bigger than a human) from magic. The Power Level of any spells cast against that person or place during the Quarter Day is decreased by the Power Level of the MAGICAL SEAL.

**SENSE MAGIC**  
RANK 1  
RANGE: Short  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: Divining rod  
As a sorcerer or druid, you automatically sense whenever someone uses magic within SHORT range or if an item you hold is charged with magical power. If you want to know more about what kind of magic is involved, you must cast the SENSE MAGIC spell. Using this spell is also required to detect OBSCURED magic (see below) – your Power Level must then be equal to or higher than the Power Level of the OBSCURE MAGIC spell.

**PASS MAGICAL RESILIENCE**  
RANK 1  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Quarter Day  
INGREDIENT: Piece of obsidian or glass  
Your may ignore up to Power Level amount of spell resilience (like that gained from the Magical Seal spell) against your spells during a Quarter Day.

**DISPEL MAGIC**  
RANK 2, POWER WORD 
RANGE: Short  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: Iron filings  
You can interfere with the spells cast by other magic users. This spell is reactive and breaks the initiative order of combat in the round. You decrease the Power Level of your opponent’s spell with the Power Level of your DISPEL . If the result is zero or less, your opponent’s spell has no effect at all. You must both roll for overcharge and mishaps, as with any other spell. You must decide how many WP you spend on your DISPEL before you both roll.

**OBSCURE MAGIC**  
RANK 2  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: Piece of cloth  
If you want to cast a spell unnoticed, you must OBSCURE your magic. This requires 1 extra Willpower Point that does not count to- ward the Power Level of the spell. OBSCURING magic does not count as an action in itself. To detect your OBSCURED spell, another magic user must actively survey the area by casting SENSE MAGIC.

**BIND MAGIC**  
RANK 3, RITUAL  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Varies  
INGREDIENT: Quill or chisel  
Skilled Sorcerers and Druids can BIND spells to dead objects to create magical traps or powerful magical artifacts. You cast the spell like any oth- er and choose how many Willpower Points to spend, but you must also spend extra WP to bind your spell to an object instead of unleashing its power immediately. Rituals cannot be BOUND.  
  Roll for any overcharge and mishap when the spell is BOUND. The extra WP do affect this roll, but don’t count toward the Power Level. If you spend one additional WP, the magic lingers for one day, or until the spell is triggered. If you spend two additional WP, the magic lingers for- ever, but dissipates when the spell is triggered. Spending five additional WP binds the spell to the object forever and it can be triggered once per day, at a cost in WP equal to the Power Level.  
  You can bind the spell in whatever manner you wish. You decide how the spell is triggered. Common methods include a certain phrase being uttered or that the object is opened, bro- ken or thrown to the ground. Once the spell is triggered, it has the same effect as if it had been cast normally.  
  If you use Bind Magic at two or five additional WP to make an effect semi-permanent or permanent, you must gain an amount of xp equal to the total WP cost, before you are able to bind magic at two or five additional WP again.

**EXTEND MAGIC**  
RANK 2  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: Hourglass (extend duration) or Spyglass (extend range)  
You can extend the power of a spell. Every Power Level spent increased the range of a spell that have a range of at least arm’s length, or doubles the duration of a spell that has a duration longer than 1 round. However, every Power Level used to extend magic, also increases the spells effective rank.

**TRANSFER**  
RANK 3  
RANGE: Arm’s Length  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: A drop of your blood  
You can use this spell to steal Willpower Points from others or to give your WP to someone else. The base cost to cast the spell is one WP, and you can then take or give as many WP as you want. If your target opposes the TRANSFER, it is not so easy – in this case, you can transfer no more WP than the Power Level of the TRANSFER. The WP used to cast TRANSFER are spent and are not transferred.

**PREPARE MAGIC**  
RANK 3  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: 1 Day  
INGREDIENT: Parchment  
You prepare a specific spell you know, so that the next time you use it, you can use it as a power word. You cannot prepare rituals in advance. Each Power Level holds the preparation for one Day (or until it is used).

**STABILIZE MAGIC**  
RANK 4, RITUAL  
RANGE: Short (targets the entire zone)  
DURATION: 1 year  
INGREDIENT: None, but see below.  
You try to stabilize the magic in a zone, causing all magical mishaps from the chosen paths of magic to be at -10 points of severity. Before casting this ritual, you must have prepared a suitable location:  
  For sorcerous magic it requires you to have a structure where you can inscribe and inlay at least the floors with runes, pentagrams or other symbols. This takes 1 week of work, requires a successful crafting roll and various minerals worth at least 10 gold.  
  For druidic magic, it requires setting up a circle of stones in a groove or other suitable place in the nature. This takes 1 week and requires a crafting roll and hewn natural stone with a combined weight of at least 250 units.  
  Every Power Level can stabilize one path of magic, but it must be a path you know. You do not need to make new crafting rolls to recast this spell, as long as the location has not been damaged. If it is, its effects immediately end.

**QUICKEN RITUAL**  
RANK 4  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: None  
This spell is cast together with a ritual. It reduces the time to cast a ritual from a Quarter Day to a Turn (15 minutes).

**CREATE ARTIFACT**  
RANK 5, RITUAL  
RANGE: Arm’s Length  
DURATION: Permanent  
INGREDIENT: None, but see below.  
This ritual must be cast at the same time as the artifact is created, most often through a crafting roll with an added -1 penalty per Power Level. If the roll is failed, the item shatters and the artifact is not created. If the roll is pushed the artifact will be corrupted, with no added Power Level. A magical mishap will in the same way corrupt it.  
  An artifact requires an ingredient for every Power Level, see the table on the next page. Ingredients cannot be combined with themselves.  
  After determining the total Power Level. The resulting artifact can have several effects with a total cost up to the Power Level. Even though the players may wish for what the artifact should do, the GM has the final say and may tweak or corrupt any and particularly breaking combinations. Artifacts should not be used as a tool for power gaming. Note that these are only examples, use your imagination.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**POWER LEVEL**|**INGREDIENT**|
|+1|**Attribute loss**: Permanently reduce one of your attributes by 1. For each attribute you have already lost to age, you may do this once for free.|
|+X|**Monster heart**: The heart or object closest resembling a heart from a monster with 10+ Strength. The object must be used within 1 week, or the effect is lost. Can add one ingredient level per 10 points of Strength.|
|+1|**Life goal**: A strong emotion that this will fulfill or will be the hallmark of someone’s goals in life. Even if the person gains a new life goal, this effect is spent.|
|+ 1/+2|**Elven ruby**: If it is an item, you can let a willing elven ruby (likely your own, killing your body) empower it for as long as it remains attached. It can then only empower permanent effects. This counts as two ingredient levels. You may also use elven ruby dust (make a resource roll to check if all remaining dust is consumed), that counts as a single ingredient level, and the dust will be destroyed.|
|+1|**Spellcaster help**: You have the help of more spellcasters, summarize the highest ranks of magic of all members, it needs to be 13 or higher. Every spellcaster that joins can also add their own ingredients.|
|+ 1/ + 2/+3|**Place of an event**: You are in a location where an event took place that will have an everlasting effect on the lands. Like +1 could be that a village was saved from doom, +2 could be something of more importance to the land than a single village, often significantly affecting 500 or more lives, and +3 would have massive effect on an entire map, like the vanishing of a powerful sovereign that given time could have claimed the entire map region (like the whole of the Forbidden Lands) if not the event had occurred. A single event can only be used once to power an artifact and must be used within a year of it occurring.|
|+ 1/ + 2, most often corrupted|**Sacrifice**: You sacrifice someone to create the item. If the target is unwilling, this counts as a corrupted ingredient. If the sacrifice is particularly large like a large group of individuals, it counts as if two likely corrupted ingredients. If you sacrifice yourself (cannot be resurrected without first reversing the effect of the spell), you count as a level 2 ingredient without adding corruption.|
|+1, corrupted|**Impure motives/Conflicted emotions**: You or someone helping you are doing this for power, or are stressed, or afflicted by any other emotions that are sucked into the casting of the spell. Circumstances like if a monster was hunted just to gain a powerful artifact heart will count as an impure action.|

FOR EACH POWER LEVEL:  
  **Artifact die**: Added with item dice of a chosen skill or as armor. Can be added to a sub-skill, like only when using endurance to resist poison, or only when fighting undead, this increases the die category by 1. If enhancing a sub-us- age and still keeping a bonus when not using that sub-us-age, it increases cost by 0.5.  
 Cost: 1 (D8), 2 (D10), 3 (D12). Minimum total Power Level of item: 2 (D8), 4 (D10), 8 (D12).  
  **Magical access**: Grants access to a spell you know as if cast by a grimoire with a set Power Level and magical rank (extra ranks can be added to reduce magical dice and risk of mishap). It still costs Willpower to use.  
 Cost: 0.5 per magical rank. Cost modifier: +0.5 if Power Level is variable. Cost modifier: -0.5 for it to be usable only once per Quarter Day. Minimum total cost: 0.5.  
  **Daily magic**: The item can cast a spell you know once per day and provides the Willpower Points needed, without any risk of magical mishap.  
 Cost per magical rank: 0.5. It provides 1 WP per X on a D8. You can upgrade to a D10 for 0.5 or to a D12 for 1, or pay 3 for +2 fixed Power Levels. Minimum total cost: 1.  
  **Permanent magic:** The item constantly affects the owner with a magical effect at Power Level 1, but only as long as the item is wielded/worn.  
 Cost: 1 if it has a normal duration of a day or more, 2 if its normally duration is a Quarter Day, 3 if its normal duration is a turn, 5 if its normal duration is a round. Also costs 0.5 per rank of the spell, add +0.5 if the effect should be togglable. Is the spell circumstantial, i.e. more unlikely then likely to benefit you during a week of adventuring? Cost modifier: x0.5.  
  **Magic on usage**: The item casts a spell on the target of its use on a successful roll. It provides the Willpower Points needed, without any risk of magical mishap. On any BANE after pushing, you are (also) targeted by the same or a reversed effect (it should be detrimental). If you have any magical resistances or immunities to the effect the item will instead try to dispel those on a PL per PL basis.  
 Cost per magical rank: 1. Cost per WP: 3. Minimum total Power Level of item: 3.  
  **Limited magic**: The item can use magic a limited number of times and then breaks.  
 Costs and works as daily magic, but can be used multiple times per day. Cost modifiers: x0.25 for 3 charges, x0.5 for it to roll a die on use, first break after rolling a BANE, x0.75 for 10 charges.  
  **Regenerating**: The artifact cannot be repaired. It instead regenerates 1 item die every day, even if it is broken,  
as long as all the pieces are held together in place.  
 Cost: 1.

RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: Related item

The GM can choose “maybe” even if she knows the answer, but believes that the true answer may disrupt the game. Note that true or false is not an objective fact, but is defined by who is asking the question. This person’s morals and beliefs can make something that is true for her false for someone else.

**TELEPATHY**  
RANK 3  
RANGE: Near  
DURATION: One turn (15 minutes)  
INGREDIENT: Item belonging to the victim  
You can read the surface thoughts of another person for a few minutes. Digging deeper for memories is harder, and requires Power Level 2 or even more, depending on how fresh the memory is. You can also use this spell to send your own thoughts to another person. In that case, the range of the spell is LONG if you know the target well. By sending thoughts of pain and suffering, you can inflict damage to Wits or Empathy equal to the Power Level. No effect on demons or undead. The victim can resist, **even when they’re unaware of being probed**, with as many insight successes as the power level.

**GUIDE**  
RANK 3  
RANGE: Arm’s Length  
DURATION: 1 turn (15 minutes)  
INGREDIENT: Held grimoire (not consumed)  
You can use this spell to grant mental aid to your allies. Up to one ally per Power Level gains a +1 bonus die to a skill you select upon casting this spell for its duration. This counts as if you help the rolls, and is therefore limited to the normal rules for helping others.

**TONGUES**  
RANK 3  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: 1 Quarter Day  
INGREDIENT: A tongue  
You can understand and speak all languages, during one Quarter Day per Power Level. The spell does however not affect your ability to read or write.

RANK 4, POWER WORD  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: An hourglass  
You ask your possible future selves to lend you some power backwards in time. Gain 2 WP for every Power Level. Then lose 1 WP every Quarter Day (if available) until the debt is paid (for 2 Quarter Days per Power Level). You cannot cast the spell again until the dept has been paid.

**MIND FOCUS**  
RANK 4  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: 1 Quarter day  
INGREDIENT: Large body of water (not consumed)  
You increase your Wits with the Power Level for a Quarter day.

**MOLD MEMORY**  
RANK 4, RITUAL  
RANGE: Arm’s Length  
DURATION: Permanent  
INGREDIENT: A pendulum  
The victim must make an insight roll with a negative modification equal to the Power Level. If she fails, you may alter any memories the victim has to your liking. The victim will recall these changed memories as if they were real. If the memories are very strange or strongly contradictory, they will instead think of them as from a very real and believable dream.

**DREAMWALK**  
RANK 4, RITUAL  
RANGE: Any  
DURATION: 1 Quarter Day  
INGREDIENT: A dream catcher  
You can enter the dreams of anyone you have encountered. They are allowed to make an insight roll with a negative modification equal to the Power Level to shake you out if they want to. During the dream you can deliver a message to the recipient. You can also turn the dream into a nightmare; this makes the target unable to benefit from sleep during that Quarter Day. The ritual works at any distance as long as you both exists in the same reality, no line-of-sight is needed. The spell will automatically fail if the target is not asleep during the ritual.

**LOCATE**  
RANK 5  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: A magnifying glass  
You can get the current hex of anyone object or person as long as they are within 2 hexes from your current location. Each extra Power Level doubles this range. If you are in the same hex as the thing you are trying to locate, extra Power Levels can instead reveal the direction to it, and/or give you a feeling of the actual distance to it.

**TIME SENDING**  
RANK 5  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: An hourglass  
You can send a message to your past self. It could be “last time we were in town, buy a hatchet and put it at the back of the wagon”, then you could look at the back of the wagon and it would be there, or the message could be “put an order to the town smith to produce a new suit of armor”. There are some caveats. First, your past self must have had enough time over to have been able to perform the action and, second, the task cannot alter what you know already has happened. So if you already looked for a hatchet on your wagon and found none, or already asked the smith to buy a non-existing suit of armor, the spell fails. You will also automatically fail to cast the spell to warn someone that could stop a fire, after such a fire already has taken place. Power Levels are needed to increase the time into the past you can contact yourself from a day, to a week, to a year. Two extra WP are needed for improbable tasks, complex task or everything that would require a skill roll. Like specifically asking the Smith to tell you that no armor exists when you come to ask for it, unless you also give a specific code word.  

### **SYMBOLISM MAGIC**  
The discipline of Symbolism uses runes, esoteric signs and symbols that reflect the underlying patterns of the world. It takes advantage of the forces unleashed by a broad spectrum of laws that are stretched, broken or twisted by the influence of these sym- bols. The signs of Symbolism can be carved, drawn, or simply formed in the air by the hands of a sorcerer. In any case, the Sorcerer needs at least one free hand.

DRAW OR CARVE: Symbolism requires no ingredients apart from the symbols themselves. If they are carved or drawn in any way, they count as ingredients from a rule standpoint, meaning that the Power Level is increased by one. Drawing a symbol takes a few minutes and cannot be done in the heat of battle. Carving a symbol into stone takes one Quarter Day or more. The Sorcerer decides when the symbol is activated. Even a drawn or carved symbol only works once.

**ENTICE**  
RANK 1  
RANGE: Short  
DURATION: Immediate  
The symbol lures the victim, who must make an INSIGHT roll with a negative modification equal to the Power Level. If the roll fails, the victim must RUN to within ARM’S LENGTH of the symbol, spending all their normal actions to do so (bonus actions from talents can still be used normally). When the victim reaches the symbol, or if the symbol is moved, the effect is broken. No effect on demons or undead.

**HORRIFY**  
RANK 1

At Power Lev- el 2, they lose their slow action. At Power Level 3, they lose both actions, and at Power Level 4, they also lose any bonus actions from talents. The spell has no effect on demons or undead.

RANK 1  
RANGE: Arm’s Length  
DURATION: One turn (15-minutes)

**ARCANE MARK**  
RANK 1, RITUAL  
RANGE: Arm’s Length  
DURATION: Special

The duration is permanent as long as that something is near you +1 day while it is no longer near you. While in effect, you can cast the ritual again to locate the direction and distance of the object and a second Power Level lets you hear what the object would hear during the ritual. When attuning to an object, each extra Power Level lets you double the duration before the attunement ends.

**BLIND**  
RANK 2  
RANGE: Short  
DURATION: Quarter Day  
The victim must make an INSIGHT roll with a negative modification equal to the Power Lev- el. If the roll fails, the symbol blinds the vic- tim. The effect of this blindness is the same as for being in [total darkness](https://forbiddenlandsopentable.obsidianportal.com/wikis/combat-and-damage#close). On victims without Wits, such as animals, the effect is automatic, but the spell has no effect on demons or undead.

**ILLUSION**  
RANK 2  
RANGE: Short  
DURATION: One turn (15 minutes)  
You make the victim see or hear something that isn’t there, or hide something that oth- erwise would be seen. A small item requires a Power Level of 1, while an object of humanoid size requires Power Level 2, and an illusion the size of a house requires Power Level 3. Only one person is affected. The victim can see through the illusion with an INSIGHT roll, but gets a penalty equal to the Power Level. This spell has no effect on demons or undead.

**MIND TRICK**  
RANK 2, POWER WORD  
RANGE: Short  
DURATION: One round  
You can force an NPC to refrain from an action they would otherwise have performed. It must be a minor action, something you can forget by being absent-minded. The victim can resist if rolling as many INSIGHT successes as power level +1.

**FALSIFY MAGIC**  
RANK 2  
RANGE: Personal  
DURATION: Immediate  
You can make your magic look like something else, even to sense magic. This requires 1 extra Willpower Point that does not count toward the Power Level of the spell. falsify magic does not count as an action in itself.

**PUPPETEER**  
RANK 3  
RANGE: Near  
DURATION: One round  
You can take complete control of your vic- tim’s actions. The victim must make an INSIGHT roll with a negative modification equal to the Power Level. If the roll fails, the vic- tim becomes a puppet without control of their own body. This control only lasts until the victim’s next ordinary turn in the initiative order, and covers one fast and one slow action. The victim cannot perform reactive actions or bonus actions from talents before the PUPPETEER’S actions are performed. The spell has no effect on demons or undead.

**POWER RUNE**  
RANK 3, RITUAL  
RANGE: Arm’s Length  
DURATION: Immediate  
You can charge a symbol with power. The sym- bol must be drawn on or carved into an object, which is then charged with a number of Will- power Points equal to the Power Level. You can use the symbol later to cast spells, emptying its stored Willpower Points. You don’t need to BIND magic to use this spell. Other spell- binders skilled in the art of runes can use your POWER RUNES if they can access them, so keep them to yourself!

**PORTAL**  
Rank 3, Ritual  
Range: Near  
DURATION: Quarter Day per Power Level  
This powerful ritual tears a hole in the veil be- tween worlds and opens a path between them. This is a very risky undertaking, since you run the risk of running into all sorts of demons and other malevolent creatures on the oth- er side – perhaps you can use them for your own purposes, but it is just as likely they will attempt to use you for their own. Or perhaps devour you. The spell BIND DEMON (see blood magic) is very useful here. The details are up to the GM.  
 Increasing Power Levels can also ensure a more spacious berth within Chermog. PL 1 opens a bloody fistula no bigger than a 2m cube. PL 3, 4m. PL 3, 8m with small tunnels/folds. PL 6, 16m chamber with larger tunnels/folds. PL 9, 32m cavern, likely populated. PL 12, open space, visible access to the rest of Chermog.  
  Another use for this spell is creating a new PORTAL on the other side, which can lead you anywhere you want in the Forbidden Lands. This 2nd portal must be made while still in Ravenlands- magic does not work in Chermog. Creating a portal does not help you find a place – you must know where it is located to be able to create the portal. Beyond the size of the portal, 1 extra Power Level lets you place a portal exit at LONG range. 2 Power Levels reaches across the same map hex where you are. Further away requires Power Level 3. Creating a portal at a location that you haven’t been to before requires an additional 2 Power Levels.

**SERENITY**  
RANK 3  
RANGE: Near  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: Amulet  
You spread harmony and serenity around you with this spell, which helps you in social conflicts.

All other restrictions for social conflicts apply – for example, the victim will not act directly against his own interests. The spell can only be used against living humanoids. Increasing the Power Level makes the spell harder to Dispell.

**PHANTASMA MORGANA**  
RANK 4, RITUAL

**VOICE OF THE MOUNTAIN**  
RANK 1, RITUAL

The mountain can answer simple ques- tions about what has happened at the location before (events over the last day require Power Level 1, events one year back in time require Power Level 2 and events even further back in time require Power Level 3) or what is happen- ing in the area right now (SHORT range requires Power Level 1, LONG range Power Level 2, any- thing within the map hex Power Level 3). Un- fortunately, the mountain speaks very slowly and therefore this spell works like a ritual. This spell can only be used in the MOUNTAIN terrain type or inside a CAVE.

RANGE: Arm’s Reach  
DURATION: 1 Turn (15 minutes)

It uses your attributes just as if you were holding it, but gains a Strength score equal to twice the Power Level for mitigating damage. If its Strength breaks, the weapon does not break, simply your hold over it. It uses its item dice as its armor rating. If the weapon breaks from having no item dice, so does your hold over it.

**CALL METEOR**  
RANK 5, RITUAL  
RANGE: Special  
DURATION: Immediate  
INGREDIENT: Drum  
This spell calls a meteor from the skies to strike a target hex. It is however very imprecise and at first ignores your directions, falling towards a random hex, 1d6 hexes away from you in a random direction. Each Power Level then refocuses the meteor moving it one hex closer to the target hex. A random area in the target hex is then utterly obliterated by the impact and fires spreads. The resulting crater will contain 1 unit of meteorite iron, but never any elven rubies. The spell was banned by the dwarves after a series of incidents, that took to many accidental lives.

**RAISE LAND**  
RANK 5, RITUAL  
RANGE: Arm’s Reach  
DURATION: Immediate

### **BLOOD MAGIC**  
Blood magic derives its power from life itself and its liquid essence – blood. Through the power of blood, the Sorcerer can both benefit and bleed the target of his spells. Typically, Blood Magic users have some sort of pact with a demon. In which case, doing the demon’s bidding grants Favor Points, Benefices, and Taints.

Practitioners of death magic, known as necromancers, can also steal power from living things by twisting and tainting them, which is the reason for much of the hate and fear these black arts stir up. The necromancers see themselves as seekers of truth, as pioneers and explorers of the true nature of life and death.

**RAISE THE DEAD**  
RANK 2, RITUAL  
RANGE: Near  
DURATION: Quarter Day  
INGREDIENT: Item belonging to the dead  
The main task of Death Magic is awakening the dead. In its simplest form, this ritual is used to reanimate one dead humanoid or animal, which will become a rank 1 undead.  
   For each Power Level beyond the first, you can reanimate one more undead, or increase the rank of all undead raised by the spell by one. A ritual with Power Level 2 can raise two undead of rank 1, Power Level 3 can raise two undead of rank 2, and so on.  
   A rank 1 undead has little to no mental capacity, but will obey simple commands and can use weapons and simple tools. The undead has the same Strength it did in life, Agility is decreased by one (no lower than 1), and it has no Wits or Empathy. Skills based on Strength and Agility are retained.  
   A rank 2 undead can be enhanced in one of the following ways:  
✥ STRONGER. The Strength score increases by 1. This effect can be chosen several times for undead of higher ranks.  
✥ SMARTER. The undead regains some of its lost mental capacity, in the form of both Wits and Empathy and skills associated with these attributes. All the scores are lowered by one (no lower than 1). The undead can answer questions about its life both before and after death, but it often has an unclear sense of time and can be very forgetful. It obeys its maker and can perform slightly more advanced tasks.  
✥ DURABLE. The duration of the spell is doubled. This effect can be chosen several times for undead of higher levels.

A rank 3 undead gets two of the effects above. A rank 4 undead gets three effects, a rank 5 gets four effects, and so on. Note that the Strong and Durable effects can be chosen several times over.  
  RAISE THE DEAD can also be used to take control of “restless dead,” beings that have died but are still walking about, unaware of the fact that they are dead. Read more about these in the Gamemaster’s Guide.
