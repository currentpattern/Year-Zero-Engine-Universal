# The Astral Plane
This is the world of pure imagination, integrated deeply with the highly generative and creative unconscious (preconscious and superconscious). This can be entered through waking meditative states (Insight: Mindful -5 / XXXX), or through Lucid Dreaming (Scholar: Psychology -1 / XX + at least 3h sleep).

## Practicing Things in Astral Plane
Time spent in the Astral Plane (AP) is half as restful as sleep. 
(Every hour spent in Astral Plane counts as 30 minutes of sleep).

Any situation that is needed in order to practice a skill may be generated within the Astral Plane. One cannot train a skill exclusively in the astral plane, however. At least half the training must be done in the waking world for a character to actually improve a skill. 

**Skills:** While training Skills or Specializations in the AP, you do not need a teacher (though you will need one for the physical aspect).
**Attributes:** Strength cannot be improved within the AP. Agility, Wits, and Empathy can.
**Talents:** Some talents may not be possible to gain through the AP. This is up the the GM. In either case, the player will need to describe what situation they are creating within the AP that will help them gain the talent. 
**Accomplishing Real World Goals:** If a character knows enough about a situation in the real world, they can accurately recreate a "simulation" of it in the AP with enough fidelity and unpredictability- with the help of their creative unconscious- that they can practice achieving a real world specific goal. This would then give them bonus dice when attempting the real activity.
For example, a character with enough knowledge of the layout of a bank, might rehearse a robbery repeatedly within the AP, giving them a heads up when doing it for real. Another example could be a character practicing a crucial conversation or negotiation: they could explore different outcomes, responses, and emotional states. Other examples could be a jail break, or a parkour route. 
Steps: 
	0) The real-world situation must be one that would take no longer than 6 hours to accomplish.
	1) How knowledgeable is the PC about the real situation? Roll a relevant skill, +1 (up to +3) for every hour the character has spent laying eyes on the actual situation. Every success improves the type of Bonus Dice they may use:
		X: D6
		XX: D8
		XXX: D10
		XXXX: D12
	2) How long are they practicing in the AP? For every 4 hours practicing in the AP, the character may have 1 Bonus Die to spend when they fail any roll involved in the chosen activity. One may accrue up to 4 Bonus Dice.
	3) This chosen real-world activity must be carried out within 4 days of the AP session before the Bonus Dice expire. Once the activity has been carried out, all Bonus Dice expire. 

## Learning Magical Spells within The Astral Plane
Characters can also imagine improbable and impossible things within the AP. Due to the nature of The Matrix, this actually increases the possibility of creating these events in "waking" life. 

Creating A Spell

1) Determine **Weirdness Level** based on the desired effect. This determines **XP Cost**, as well as base **Difficulty Modifier (DM)*** and base **Casting Time**. -1 weirdness level if target can resist effects through non-magical skill roll. Decide what mundane skill is used in the casting of the spell. This is called the “**Accord Skill.**”
2) For every 3 dice in your Accord skill, add +1 to your Insight: Magic roll for this particular spell. This total now becomes the **Casting Dice** for this spell.
3) Modify the **Casting Time** for the spell
4) Decide **Duration** of the spell.
5) Decide **Range** of the spell. How far away is the point/subject where your spell arises?
6) If the spell usually effects others, the determine the base **Relationship** modifier. Note that you can shift this up or down during gameplay.
7) Total up the Difficulty Modifier. Spend as many hours in the Astral Plane learning the spell as the XP cost multiplied by the total DM if it is under 0. 

### 1) Determining Weirdness Level and Accord Skill
 In order to first acquire a magical spell, the character must spend XP learning it in the Astral Plane. The amount of XP spent to learn the spell is determined by the roll of a chosen Accord Skill:  a skill most closely applicable to the magical spell. This represents how the character makes sense of the mechanisms of the magical effect. Characters who come from a background of traditional magic schools may simply have that particular class of magic as a Scholar specialty. These can be used as Accord Skills when crafting a spell from that tradition. 
 
 The player must describe, in psycho-techno-babble relating to their accord skill, the specific kind of mechanism whereby the spell can happen (imagery as language for the unconscious). The more this mechanism deviates from what is considered possible in consensus reality (“Weirdness”), the more difficult the spell is to weave. You may then roll the Accord Skill to reduce the initial XP cost. Every Success reduces 1 XP of cost. The roll may be pushed, but every pushed Bane increases the cost by 1 XP.

| Weirdness Level                                                                               | Base XP Cost | Base Difficulty Modifier | Base Casting Time |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1. Subtle (unnoticeable by others, with naturalistic effects)                                 | 1            | -1                       | Fast Action       |
| 2. Noticeable (could be mundane trickery. Believable but noteworthy)                          | 2            | -2                       | Slow Action       |
| 3. Weird (very strange, possibly pseudo-scientific.)                                          | 3            | -3                       | 1 Whole Round     |
| 4. Paranormal (Obviously incredible. Strains one's notion of reality.)                        | 4            | -4                       | 2 Rounds          |
| 5. Fantastic (Defies common sense but aligns with magical or fantastical logic)               | 5            | -5                       | 3 Rounds          |
| 6. Mindblowing (Overwhelms the mind with sheer impossibility, radically altering perception.) | 6            | -6                       | 1 minute          |
| 7. Legendary (Transcendent, bordering on mythic and capable of becoming legend)               | 7            | -7                       | 15 Minutes        |

### 2) Casting Dice
For every 3 dice in your Accord skill, add +1 to your Insight: Magic roll for this particular spell. This total now becomes the **Casting Dice** for this spell.

### 3) Modify Spell's Casting Time (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
This refers to how long it takes you to cast the spell. There are 8 Increments of Casting Time. The Weirdness Level of the spell introduces Base Casting Time. 

Every increment you make the Casting Time faster = -1 DM

Every increment you make the Casting Time slower = +1 DM

### 4) Spell Duration (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)

| Duration       | Difficulty Modifier |
| -------------- | :-----------------: |
| Up to 1 round  |          -          |
| Concentration* |         -1          |
| 1 hour         |         -2          |
| 1 QD           |         -3          |
| 24 hours       |         -4          |
| 1 week         |         -6          |
| 1 month        |         -7          |
| Permanent      |         -10         |
### 5) Spell Range (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
How far away is the point/subject where your spell arises?

| Range                                   | Difficulty Modifier |
| --------------------------------------- | :-----------------: |
| Self                                    |          -          |
| Arm's Length<br>up to 2m                |         -1          |
| Short<br>up to 10m                      |         -2          |
| Medium<br>up to 20m                     |         -3          |
| Long<br>up to 100m                      |         -4          |
| Extreme<br>up to 300m<br>/ out of sight |         -5          |
### 6) Relationship / Area of Effect (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
If the spell usually effects others, the determine the base Relationship modifier. Note that you can shift this up or down during gameplay.

| Relationship / Area of Effect    | Difficulty Modifier |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 friend / self                  | -                   |
| 1 non-friend / several friends   | -1                  |
| 2-7 non-friends / Arm's L radius | -2                  |
| Group (8-100), 10m radius        | -3                  |
| Mob (101+), 20m radius           | -4                  |
| Audience (500+), 100m radius     | -5                  |
| Multitude (1000+), 300m radius   | -6                  |
### 7) Total Difficulty Modifier, Spend Time Learning
Total up the Difficulty Modifier. When determining the Difficult Modifier, some modifiers introduce +/- .25 or .5. Add all modifiers’s according to normal rules of arithmetic, then round to the nearest whole number (up in the case of .5). 

Spend as many hours in the Astral Plane learning the spell as the XP cost multiplied by the total DM if it is less than 0. Name the spell, and record it as follows.

Spell Name: Effect (Duration)
Accord, (Casting Dice-DM), Casting Time, Range, Relationship

Example: 
*Double Vision: +1 to dodge by creating an illusory vibrating aura (Concentration)*
*Move: dodge 4D, 2rnd, Arm's L., 

Double Vision
Move: dodge 4D, Arm's L, 2 rounds, Duration: Concentration
+1 to dodge by creating an illusory vibrating aura

**CASTING KNOWN SPELLS**
**1)** Adjust the Difficulty Modifier by use of an **Instrument**, by **Relationship,** and/or by paying a **Price**.

**2)** Roll **Casting Dice**. Roleplay/describe the spell’s performance.

For every success beyond the first, you may also alter any of the following by one increment: Casting time, Duration, Range.

**3)** Success achieves desired effect.



You may also be decreasing **Casting Time,** Increasing **Duration** or **Range** by 1 increment, or add a **Price** to reduce difficulty.

**Note**: _Increasing Weirdness Level at all_, or _increasing Duration or Range by 2 or more increments_ counts as casting a spell you don’t know.


### Using an Instrument
Turning an object into an instrument requires the use of a Subtle (Weirdness Level 1) spell intended to imbue an object with such a capability. In other words, if the spell involved **permanently** imbuing an object by **touching** the object and taking **1 fast action**, it would be a -11 spell. If the spell required **1 Quarter Day**, it would be a -4 spell. 

| Instrument                                                                 | Difficulty Modifier |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| No Instrument                                                              | -1                  |
| General Instrument <br>(for multiple spells)                               | -                   |
| Instrument includes piece of <br>target/result                             | +1                  |
| Instrument used only for this spell                                        | +1                  |
| Acquiring or creating the instrument<br>required a roll at -3, or with XXX | +1                  |

Casting successfully automatically comes with a risk of attracting Agents. 
Failure should incur less of a risk of Agents, unless it triggers unintended magical consequnces.
	Agents should be more likely depending on two factors:
	1) Weirdness Level
	2) Number of witnesses
Just how many Agents I want to throw at the PCs depends on how powerful the Agents are. 

AGENTS POWER
	1) Their physical and magical abilities
		Should be substantial. Perhaps even equivalent to PCs level.
	2) Their networked resources
		In theory this is incredible: able to leverage all human authorities, as well as the simulation itself.
			HUMAN AUTHORITIES: They have ambiguous credentials of mysterious government agencies which nobody has heard of. Most cops, etc. would blindly follow their commands, but some perceptive cops, particularly those not corrupt might be more motivated to question the credentials of the Agents, leading to conflict.
			SIMULATION LEVERAGING: These are BS subroutines, not capable of altering much of the simulation directly. Perhaps limited to Weirdness Level 5.
