CHARACRE
### **AGE**
Age is divided into three categories: young, adult, and old. You choose your age freely. Write down your choice on your character sheet. Your chosen age category affects your attributes and your skills. Read more about these below.

| Category | Range | Attribute Points | Skill Points | Skill Specialties |
| -------- | ----- | :--------------: | :----------: | :---------------: |
| Young    | 16-25 |        15        |      8       |         3         |
| Adult    | 26-54 |        14        |      12      |         4         |
| Old      | 55+   |        13        |      16      |         5         |
### **ATTRIBUTES**
Your adventurer has four attributes that indicate your basic physical and mental capabilities. Your attributes are used when you roll dice to perform actions in the game, and also how much damage of various kinds you can withstand before you become Broken.

KEY ATTRIBUTE: You have 2 selections for Key Attributes. You MAY select the same one twice, or two different attributes. Your Key Attribute(s) are areas your character is unusually strong in.

STARTING SCORES: When you create your player character, you can distribute a number of Attribute Points (depending on your Age, above) across your attributes.
**You can assign no less than 2 and no more than 4 points to any attribute**. However, you can assign **5 points** to the Key Attribute. If you have chosen a single attribute as Key twice, you can assign up to **6 points** to this attribute.

**STRENGTH**: Raw muscle power, brawn, and stamina.  
Skills: Might, Endurance, Melee
.
**AGILITY**: Body control, speed, and motor skills.  
Skills: Stealth, Move, Marksmanship, Driving, Piloting (Adv. Req. Driving 2)
.
**WITS**: Sensory perception, intelligence, and sanity.  
Skills: Observation, Survival, Crafting, Scholar, Technical
.
**EMPATHY**: Ability to understand and influence others minds & lives.
Skills: Insight, Influence, Animal Handling, Medical Aid (Adv. Req. Scholar: Medicine 2)
### **Skills**  
Your skills are the knowledge and abilities you have acquired during your life as an adventurer or prior to it. They are important, as they determine, along with your attributes, how effectively you can perform certain actions in the game. There are many skills, and they are all described in detail in [Skills and Rolling the Dice](Skills%20and%20Rolling%20the%20Dice.md) section. They are measured by skill level on a scale from 0 to 5 and higher. The higher the number, the better.

NO SKILL LEVEL? You can always roll for a skill even if you have no level in that skill – in that case you only use the associated attribute for the skill in question, and gear. 

STARTING SKILL LEVELS: When you create your player character, you distribute a number of points to your skills. How many points is determined by your Age, see above. You can **assign from 1 to 3 points to any skills you choose.** You can increase your skill levels during the game through training.

| Skill Level | Description                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5           | Elite                                                         |
| 4           | Veteran                                                       |
| 3           | Experienced                                                   |
| 2           | Trained. Average <br>for someone who <br>practices this skill |
| 1           | Novice                                                        |

### **Skill Specialties**
Each skill can cover many possible uses (e.g. DRIVING covers any ground effect vehicle). However, you can branch out from a skill: each skill has several sub-skills called Specialties which only cover much more limited use-cases (e.g. DRIVING: Trucker covers vehicles with trailers, or more than 4 wheels). Improving a specialty costs significantly less XP than improving the skill as a whole. 

STARTING SPECIALTY LEVELS: You may choose 3, 4, or 5 Skill Specialties, depending on your Age, see above. You start the game with 2 more skill points in each chosen specialty, but you can choose to forgo one specialty for starting the game with 4 points in another. You can increase your Skill Specialty levels and learn new ones through training during the game. 

### **Talents**
Talents are special qualities, abilities, and gifts that a character might have which skills and specializations may not capture. They may be things like needing less sleep than usual, responding to panic in a novel way, or having extra fast initiative. Talents are described in the [Skills and Rolling the Dice](Skills%20and%20Rolling%20the%20Dice.md)

STARTING TALENTS: All characters start with 1 talent of their choosing. Depending on your age, you may choose more:
**Adult**: 2 talents
**Old**: 3 talents
### **Pride**  
Adventurers aren’t like other people. Leaving home and family to go out adventuring, risking life and limb, requires both courage and the conviction that you are an individual beyond the norm. This is represented in the game by your Pride – something specific you are very proud of. It can be an ability, something from your past, or something else. You are free to come up with your own Pride specific to you.

Once per game session, when you fail a skill roll in a situation where your Pride is relevant, you can activate it. When activated, this allows you to roll an extra D12 on the pushed roll and include the result in your roll. Keeping in mind that 6+ is success, this is very powerful. If you still fail the roll (not necessarily on the Pride die, but in general), you remove your Pride. You then have to play one entire session without a Pride, and then choose a new one.
### **Dark Secret**  
Every character has a story. You have experienced something before the game begins that has left its mark on you or still threatens you in some way – this is your Dark Secret. You can come up with your own. 

The Dark Secrets are primarily something for you and the GM to build stories with, but if it comes up in play and impacts you, it’s also worth an XP in the session. Note that Dark Secrets don't have to be kept secret from other players in order for them to function. View a Dark Secret as a roleplay cue. The player has the PC make decisions that act against what would otherwise be in their best interest for themselves in a given situation because of their Dark Secret. They are then rewarded for the RP during XP phase when they do so in an interesting way.

### **Relationships: Anchors and PCs**
ANCHORS
Your character likely has many people in their life, but may have a small number (if they're lucky). You may have up to two people, whether they are PCs or NPCs who are extremely important to you. In game, you can spend an hour with them to relieve all Stress. An Anchor can be someone like a friend, a lover, your parent, or your child.  
Without specific a specific talent, you can never have more than two Anchors, but you can lose them if, for instance, they get killed or if they become mad at you and tell you to stay away from them. 

PC RELATIONSHIPS
Every adventurer is an individual with personal relationships to the other characters. Perhaps you have been part of the same adventuring group for a while, and you know each other fairly well.

You should describe your relationships with each of the other characters you know, with a short sentence for each on your sheet. You can make up your relationships from whole cloth. Please consider these and write them, it will assist in story creation in the long term and cement the characters together. 

### **Reputation**
As you adventure through the world, word of your deeds will spread – assuming you live long enough. This is represented by your Reputation scores, which will determine the chance of you being recognized and can affect social conflicts.

You have two types of reputation and up to 3 levels of reputation.

The two types of reputation are:
**Justice**- your reputation for upholding the public good,
**Cruelty**- reputation for destruction, and abuse of power.
Add the scores together for the purpose of social conflict or being recognized.

The three levels of reputation are:
**Village Reputation**- How well known you are among the people in a neighborhood, borough, village, town, or medium organization. 10 of these is 1 Regional Reputation
**Regional Reputation**- How well known you are in a ~200km region, or large city with modern media, or large organization. 10 of these is 1 Global Reputation.
**Global Reputation**- How well known you are across the larger known world.

Depending on your age and social class, you start with a certain degree of Regional Reputation. You may choose how much of it is Cruelty vs Justice.

| Age   | Low Class | Middle Class | Upper Class |
| ----- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Young | 0         | 0            | 1           |
| Adult | 1         | 2            | 3           |
| Old   | 2         | 3            | 4           |

### **Gear**
The last step in the PC creation process is for you to pick your starting gear. The GM might assign gear to you, or might let you pick 1D6+1 non-rare items from a list of gear, or allow you to purchase gear before play using your Starting Capital.

STARTING CAPITAL: The currency in the setting may take many forms, though for the sake of generics, we will call the currency (be it copper coins, dollars) "credits" for character creation. Your social class determines how many credits you start the game with, along with your starting gear. If appropriate, your GM may decide to give you a savings. Based on setting, class, story factors and GM fiat, monthly wages are decided upon. **Every success on a SCHOLAR: Business roll indicates how many months worth of wages you have in your savings.** 

TRACKING MONEY: As a rule of thumb, during play, if a character is above Lower class, and an expense is less than 3% of their actual monthly earnings, it does not need to be kept track of. You'll spend 90% (-10% per X of a SCHOLAR: Business roll) of monthly wages at the beginning of the month as "upkeep" cost for basic necessities. 

| Wealth Level       | Gear Buy                    | Monthly Wages,<br>Malthusian setting | Monthly Wages,<br>Modern setting | Monthly Living Expenses<br>(-10% per  SCHOLAR: Business X) | Current Savings: Monthly Wages x M / (M per SCHOLAR: Business X) |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0. Extreme Poverty | 1D6 x 100                   | 0-100                                | 4D6 x 50<br>(0-1,000 )           | 100% Income                                                | None                                                             |
| 1. Lower Class     | 2D6 x 100 <br>(600-800)     | 100-200                              | 4D6 x 100<br>(1,000-2,000)       | 90% Income                                                 | M = .3                                                           |
| 2. Middle Class    | 4D6 X 100 <br>(1,000-1,400) | 300-1500                             | 4D6 x 250<br>(2,000-5,000)       | 75% Income                                                 | M = .75                                                          |
| 3. Upper Class     | 2D6 x 1000<br>(6000-8000)   | 2000-5000                            | 4D6 x 625<br>(5,000- 12,000)     | 60% Income                                                 | M = 2                                                            |



### **Encumbrance**  
You can carry a number of regular items equal to double your Strength attribute. This is not reduced if you take damage to your strength, so you don’t suddenly drop everything if you take damage.

An item described as **Heavy** counts as two items, and an item described as **Light** count as half, so you can put two on one row of your Character Sheet.

**Tiny** items don’t count at all. if the item can be hidden in a closed fist, it’s tiny. Tiny items also need to be listed on your character sheet. single coin is tiny, 100 coins is light, 200 is regular, 400 is heavy.

**OVER ENCUMBERED** 
You can temporarily carry more than your normal encumbrance limit: (Strength x 2) items. In this case, you need to make a roll for the ENDURANCE skill whenever you want to RUN in a round of combat or HIKE for a Quarter Day. If the roll fails, you must either drop what you are carrying, stay where you are, or suffer one point of damage to Agility and keep going.

If you are carrying (Strength x 3) items, you are OVER ENCUMBERED, and suffer -2 on all Move rolls.  
If you attempt to carry (Strength x4) items, you cannot move at all.

### **Consumables**
In survival situations, you must keep track of your food and water. 
You must eat 1 unit of food per day or gain the condition HUNGRY. A Knapsack carries 10 Food units max, and weighs 1 if not empty.
You must drink 1 unit of water per day (more on extremely hot days) or gain the condition THIRSTY. A waterskin or canteen holds 10 days of water max, and weighs 1 if not empty.

### **Appearance**  
You can describe your player character’s face, body and clothing on your character sheet. Consider your profession and your age, and freely choose an appearance that you think fits your adventurer.

### **Name**  
Finally, you give your adventurer a name.

### **Experience**  
Life as an adventurer brings many challenges, and if you survive you can be certain you will change and maybe even learn a thing or two along the way.  

The things you learn during the game are measured in Experience Points (XP). You receive XP after the end of each game session. Talk it through and let the whole group discuss what has happened. For each of the below questions that you can reply “yes” to, you get one XP:

- Did you participate in the game session? You get one XP just for being there.	      
- Did you travel through at least one hex on the game map, village, or neighborhood that you had not visited before?         
- Did you discover a new adventure site?

- Did you activate your Pride?   
- Did you inconvenienced by your Dark Secret?         
- Did you intentionally risk your life (50/50 chance of death) for any character?       
- Did you perform a truly memorable action of some kind?      
- Was your PC strongly affected by one of your PC relationships?	    
- Accomplish a multi-session character-goal

- Gain 2 local reputation 	
- Gain 1 regional reputation 
- Gain 1 Global reputation
- Contributed to solving a multi-session, single-site problem    

# **Develop Your Character**  
You can **spend your XP** to improve your Attributes, Skills and Talents, or to learn new ones. You can only spend XP during a Quarter Day when you REST or SLEEP.

SKILLS
To increase a skill level by one step costs a number of XP equal to the skill level you want to attain multiplied by 5. For example, an increase from skill level 2 to 3 costs 15 XP. You can only increase a skill level one step at a time. Learning a new skill (at skill level 1) costs 5 XP. Also, you must either have used the skill and succeeded (without skill level) during the session, or be instructed by a teacher (at skill level 1 or more) during a Quarter Day. See the table below for XP costs.

| Desired Skill level | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **XP Cost**         | 5   | 10  | 15  | 20  | 25  | 30  | 35  | 40  | 45  | 50  |

SPECIALIZATIONS
Specializations, if improved upon, detach from their parent skill and are treated like their own, cheaper, more focused skill. 

To increase a specialization by one step costs a certain number of XP:
	From 1-4, multiply the skill level you want to attain multiplied by 1.5 (rounded up). 
	For 5, the cost is 10
	For all higher skill levels, multiply the desired level by 2.5 (rounded down)
You can only increase a Specialization one step at a time. Also, you must either have used the specialization and succeeded (without skill level) during the session, or be instructed by a teacher with a higher skill than you during a Quarter Day. See the table below for XP costs.
[Brainstorming specialization cost](Brainstorming%20specialization%20cost.md)

| Desired Specialty Level | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **XP Cost**             | 2   | 3   | 5   | 6   | 10  | 15  | 17  | 20  | 22  | 25  |

ATTRIBUTES
To increase a given Attribute by one step costs a number of XP equal to the cost of increasing _each skill under the attribute_ by one, plus the Attribute level you want to attain multiplied by 3. The skill levels remain unchanged. Training time is 5 quarter days. These quarter days may be broken up, but all 5 must take place within 1 week.  
_e.g. Kivil wants to improve his EMPATHY from 2 to 3. He has Manipulation 0, Performance 1, Healing 0, Animal Handing 0. Total cost of improving EMPATHY would be 34xp (25 for skills, 9 for attribute). The skill levels remain unchanged._

GAIN A TALENT 
Talents do not contain ranks or levels, so cannot be improved. You may gain a new talents by either a Quarter Day of practice, or a plot event that makes sense to explain gaining a talent, then a successful Wits roll, and spending 10 XP. 

CHANGE YOUR PRIDE  
If you activate your Pride in a skill roll, but still fail, you must immediately erase your Pride. You must then play one entire game ses- sion without a Pride, and after that you get to choose a new Pride for yourself. 

CHANGE YOUR DARK SECRET  
If you, after the end of a game session, feel that your Dark Secret is no longer relevant, you can erase it and come up with a new one. Perhaps your secret has been revealed, or the ominous threat is no longer an issue. Come up with a new Dark Secret together with the GM. Try to connect the new Dark Secret to something that has happened during the course of the game.

CHANGE RELATIONSHIPS  
After the end of a game session, you are free to redefine your relationships to the other PCs as you see fit.

GROWING YOUR REPUTATION
During the game, your Reputation score will increase. After a game session in which you have performed one or more great or terrible deeds of some kind, one which was made known to the world and will be spoken of for years to come, your Reputation score increases one point. What counts as a “great or terrible deed” is up to the GM, but here are some examples:

**Village Reputation**
Deeds performed at an adventure site, neighborhood, borough, village or town, can change your reputation in that specific site. Every 10 points of Local Reputation at a site translates into 1 point of Regional Reputation.

Total Local Reputation at any given site caps at a maximum of 10. If a Just or a Cruel act would raise the Total above 10, its opposite category must be lowered to compensate. If a category is already maxed, further deeds decrease the Reputation of the opposite category. The exception is if your Local Cruelty score has already reached 10- no amout of Just actions can lower it again.

| Just Village Act                                                           | **Justice Reputation Increase** |

| You are witnessed breaking the local custom or law.                                 | +1                              |
