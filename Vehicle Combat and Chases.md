# VEHICLE COMBAT
**Driving under normal circumstances**: NO DICE ROLLS  
**More advanced maneuvers**: DRIVING. Use the MANEUVERABILITY rating of the vehicle as the attribute die.  
**Pushing DRIVING rolls**: any BANES  rolled inflict 1 point of Stress, ==and either reduce your AGILITY or vehicle's RELIABILITY rating by one.== 

GETTING IN AND OUT
Getting on or off a motorcycle or bicycle: **fast action**.   
Getting into or out of most vehicles: **slow action**.   
Starting a vehicle: **fast action**.

## VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES
**PASSENGERS**: The number of people that can ride in the vehicle, in addition to the driver.

**SPEED**: When in vehicle combat that is not technically a Chase, this rating is how many 10m the vehicle can more for 1 fast action.

**MANEUVER**: This rating is used as the base attribute for all DRIVING skill rolls with this vehicle. Fast and agile vehicles have higher MANEUVER than slow and heavy ones.

**RELIABILTY**: How much damage the vehicle can take before becoming Wrecked. ==For each BANE rolled after pushing a DRIVING roll, the drive may choose: 1) Reduce vehicle RELIABILIITY rating one step. 2) Reduce your own AGILITY one step. If RELIABILITY drops to zero, the vehicle breaks down and becomes inoperable, before the extra movement (after the safe distance)==

**ARMOR**: The Armor rating of the vehicle.

## VEHICLES IN COMBAT
When operating a vehicle in combat, you can make moves just like on foot, but you cannot seek cover with a vehicle. To break through barriers as part of a vehicle's movement (assuming the GM deems it possible), roll DRIVING instead of MIGHT.

**VEHICLE WEAPONS:** Some vehicles are fitted with mounted heavy weapons, fired by the crew. Using MARKSMANSHIP or MELEE from a vehicle that has moved in the last round incurs a -2 penalty.

**RAMMING ENEMIES** : Most vehicles can be used as weapons (i.e., to simply run your target over). It counts as a close combat attack but both attacker and defender roll for DRIVING. The **base Damage rating of the attack equals your vehicle’s RELIABILITY rating divided by two, rounded up, + Speed difference of the attack.**
>>**Sideswipes** typically occur with 0-1 speed difference  
>>**Rear-ending** also typically occurs at 0-1 speed difference, unless the result of a chase round closes distance  below ARM'S L. The speed would be 1 per Range increment closed (e.g. Short to Below Arm's L = 2 increments = 2 speed)  
>>**T-bones** typically occur at attacker's speed (e.g. 4-7)  
>>**Head-ons** occur at attacker + defender's speed (e.g. 8-14)  
## DAMAGE TO VEHICLES
Vehicles suffer damage just like people. When a vehicle has suffered damage equal to or in excess of its RELIABILITY rating, it is Wrecked. 

**WRECKED**: Vehicle suffers CRITICAL DAMAGE, and is inoperable. Roll D12 on the Critical Damage Table. Every point of damage that brings the vehicle's RELIABILITY rating below 0 is inflicted as direct damage to all passengers (Blunt damage, Armor counts). If passengers see the crash coming, they can brace themselves for the hit by rolling MOBILITY- each rolled X reduces the damage by one.

**ARMOR**: Most vehicles have an Armor rating. Vehicle armor works just like body armor – roll as many Base Dice as indicated by the Armor rating. Each rolled X decreases the damage by one point. If the damage is reduced to zero, no damage occurred.

**CRITICAL DAMAGE**: When the RELIABILITY rating is reduced to zero, or an attacker successfully deals XX or more on an attack, the vehicle suffers CRITICAL DAMAGE. Roll on the Vehicle Critical Damage table. If the RELIABILITY has reached zero, roll a D12. 
XX rolls D8 
XXX rolls D10
XXXX rolls D12
A critical hit from a MELEE attack against a vehicle is always rolled with a D6, irrespective of the Strength of the attacker.

**PASSENGERS**: The driver and passengers in a vehicle can be hit by critical damage to a vehicle. If they are visible, they can also be targeted directly by a ranged attack. In a ground car, this counts as cover and counts as armor. A person riding on a cycle of some kind does not benefit from cover.  If vehicle is WRECKED, every point of damage that brings the vehicle's RELIABILITY rating below 0 is inflicted as direct damage to all passengers (Blunt damage, Armor counts). If passengers see the crash coming, they can brace themselves for the hit by rolling MOBILITY- each rolled X reduces the damage by one.

## AERIAL VEHICLES
Aerial vehicles are handled in much the same way as ground vehicles, with some exceptions:

ALTITUDE: At all times you must keep track of the vehicle's altitude, measured in zones. When moving, you distribute the zones moved on vertical and horizontal movement. When on the ground, the Speed of aerial vehicles is typically 1.

CRASHES: If an aerial vehicle is Wrecked, it crashes violently to the ground. All people inside suffer damage equal to the altitude (in zones) multiplied by 3. You can brace yourself for the hit by rolling MOBILITY- each rolled X reduces the damage by one.

## REPAIRS
Repairing damage to a vehicle requires one or several TECH rolls. One roll can be made per Shift. Only one person can roll to repair the hull, but others can help. Each rolled removes one point of damage. If the vehicle was Wrecked, it is no longer considered Wrecked once one point of damage has been repaired.

COMPONENT DAMAG E : If the engine or a mounted weapon has been disabled due to a critical hit, repairing it typically requires a TECH roll, in addition to any roll for repairing hull damage. The work takes one Shift.
# STARTING THE CHASE
A chase can either start directly from a role-playing situation, or it can follow directly after combat if someone runs off and leaves the combat map.

In either case, the GM declares that a chase is now in progress and decides the starting range between the participants- ARM'S L; SHORT; MEDIUM; LONG-  up to a maximum of LONG range. Distances in a chase are measured only in range categories (not zones). Most chases are between just two parties – the pursuer and their prey. For guidelines on using multiple participants, see the section below.

# RESOLUTION
Chases are played out in Rounds just like combat, but no initiative is drawn ==and both moves and actions are not performed==. Instead, each participant gets one maneuver (described below) each Round, chosen in secret and then revealed, while the GM randomly generates obstacles to place in their way. 

The following procedure is used each Round of the chase:
1. Each participant selects a maneuver, in secret.
2. The GM randomly generates an obstacle and reveals it.
3. The pursuer and prey both reveal their maneuver.
4. Maneuver skill rolls are resolved, with the prey going first and the ­pursuer last.

A player or NPC is allowed to cancel a planned maneuver, but no other maneuver may be chosen instead – the participant simply does nothing in the Round. Maneuvers require skill rolls. These rolls can be affected by the chase obstacle revealed by the GM before the maneuver is resolved. Skills and other factors used for
vehicles are indicated.

**RUNNERS Vs VEHICLES**
If one participant in a chase is running while the other is in a vehicle, the chase rules work normally – just use the applicable skill for each participant (MOVE /DRIVING). In a bustling street environment, it’s not necessarily faster to be driving, but the driver will be more protected. However, in a more open environment where the greater speed of a vehicle comes into play, the participant in a vehicle gets a +2 to all Pursue/Flee rolls in a chase against an opponent on foot.

**MULTIPLE PARTICIPANTS**
If there are more than two participants in a chase, there are two ways to resolve it.

1) The simplest way is to divide the participants into two sides. Only the slowest person/vehicle on each side – the one with the lowest total die size on their Base Dice (free choice on a tie) – performs maneuvers and rolls dice, except for the Stand and Shoot maneuver, which all participants on the side can perform.
2)  A more complex way to resolve chases with multiple participants is to let each perform maneuvers separately. You will then need to keep track of the relative distances between each participant. A sheet of paper indicating range bands can be useful for this. In this model, the Pursue/Flee maneuver will move you forward relative to all other participants in the chase. For all other maneuvers, you must indicate which other participant you wish to target, and all limitations refer to your position relative to the target. You count as pursuer in relation to all participants in front of you, and as prey in relation to all participants behind you.

**FIRING FROM VEHICLES**
Passengers can make ranged attacks from a vehicle in a chase, and these attacks are performed immediately after the driver’s maneuver is resolved. However, such attacks get a -2 if the driver performs any maneuver except STAND AND SHOOT.

Advanced military and police vehicles can have mounted weapons with targeting systems. Such weapons can be fired by a gunner without penalty even when the driver does not STAND AND SHOOT. Some very advanced vehicles even have automated targeting systems with their own MARKSMANSHIP skill and can fire at the driver’s command (no action), eliminating the need for a gunner.

**ENDING THE CHASE**
A chase can end as a result of maneuvers or obstacles. It can also end if prey decides to end it at the beginning of a new Round – to give up or to stand and fight. In the latter case, draw initiative and commence combat.
# CHASE OBSTACLES
Each Round, after the participants have secretly chosen their maneuvers, the GM randomly generates a chase obstacle. ==There are three tables for chase obstacles on the following pages – for foot chases, ground vehicle chases, and aerial pursuits.== The obstacles provide flavor for the chase and can also affect the maneuvers chosen by the participants in different ways. The GM is free to adapt the obstacles to the situation at hand, or even choose to create obstacles freely as needed. 

CHASE OBSTACLE EFFECTS

FOOT


SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS
 The prey must roll Persuasion (no action) to convince them to move. Success gives a +2 modifier to any Hide maneuver. A failed roll means that the prey’s maneuver fails automatically. (a crowd that can be persuaded, monks) 
−2 modifier to Pursue/Flee, Hide and Stand and Shoot. Anyone who performs the Stand and Shoot maneuver will be attacked. (guards/police blocking the chase) 
D6 hostiles block.  Prey must roll Persuasion (no action) to be allowed to pass. A failed roll means that the hostiles attack – the chosen maneuver fails automatically and one hostile attacks in close combat. If the Persuasion roll succeeds, the hostiles will attack the pursuer instead. (street thugs)
