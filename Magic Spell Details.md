# Teleportation WL Point Buy
Base Weirdness Level of a teleportation spell: 10 (which is not possible) 
Adding the following features reduces the WL by 1 each, to a minimum of WL 3: 
1) Teleporting maintains your momentum (if you were moving at 30mph, teleporting doesn't stop that. If you are falling, teleporting won't save you unless you teleported to the ground ASAP) 
2) Teleporting maintains your direction of travel (if you were moving west, teleporting doesn't change that) 
3) Sound/popping: teleporting causes a loud vacuum implosion at starting point. 
4) smoke/visual transit: vanishing/appearing is accompanied by a notable visual effect, e.g. black smoke, bright flash 
5) Medium requirement: in order to teleport, you must step into and emerge from some medium (e.g. shadow, reflection, doorway, water, fire) 
6) Visible portal: the spell creates a floating "portal" that you must step through 
7) Must be in line of sight of destination 
8) You must have been to the destination before 
9) Nobody is visually seeing you disappear/appear

If you have directly seen the location where such information could be learned, you could create a companion, Info Homing spell, that directs you to the location where a piece of information could be found. See "Locate Spell WL Point Buy" section

# Sensing Magic
- WL 2: Passive detect magic- "a spell is active at a specific spot/area." No further info.
- WL 3: Knowing the WL of the magic you’re sensing, and how many successes the caster had. If it is a magical artifact, how many spells are inside it, the WL levels, and how many successes the caster had.
- WL 4+: Get (WL + 4) dice to roll to understand a spell. The roll is modified by half the WL of the target spell (e.g. target WL 2 = -1 DM; target WL 8 = -4 DM). Each success reveals 1d6 of the following, caster's choice.
	- Effect
	- Number of casters
	- Duration
	- Range, aoe/rel
	- Any modified casting time
	- Price
	- Toggleable/activations

**How many casting dice does entity have?**

| Dice | WL   |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0    | WL 1 |
| 3    | WL 2 |
| 5    | WL 3 |
| 8    | WL 4 |
| 10   | WL 5 |
| 12   | WL 6 |
| 14   | WL 7 |
| 16   | WL 8 |
May divide casting dice into any number of spells

**What WL can entity cast?** 
WL of an entity's spells is 1 less than the WL of their chosen casting dice number. E.g. WL 5 entity with 10D casting dice can have any number of WL 4 spells. Increasing the WL an entity can cast by 1 raises the casting WL by 1. 

**How many general skill points does entity have?** 
str, agil, wits, emp, relevant skills, armor, weapon dam, weapon bonus:
14 = CR .5 weak person 0
18 = CR 1 armed guard -2
23 = CR 1.5 soldier -4
27 = tough soldier -6
32 = very high end monster -8
37 = extremely skilled/tough (large dragon) -10
str+agil+wits+armor / 9 = defensive tallies
relevant skills+weapon dam+weapon bonus / 9 = CR

WL = (casting dice DM + Skill DM)/2.3
12 -7, 0 = WL 3

**How free is the entity?**
- **Unbounded:** Entity acts completely independently according to its agenda/nature/personality, and like a monster, cannot be influenced except through magical means.  -0
- **superficial bond/rebellious**: Entity generally resists direction and acts on its own agenda. May occasionally comply with requests that align with its interests. INFLUENCE works like it does with a stranger.  -1 
- **Loose binding/ornery:** Entity follows simple, safe requests but balks at anything demanding or dangerous. Interprets commands broadly to minimize effort or risk. INFLUENCE roll required for specific/detailed commands, risky actions, or tasks over half spell duration. -2
- **moderate binding/agreeable:** Entity is generally cooperative but retains moral/ethical boundaries. INFLUENCE roll required for orders that are dangerous or contradict its values. -3
- s**trong binging/compliant:** Entity obeys most orders willingly, even unpleasant ones. INFLUENCE roll required only with suicidal commands or actions violating core nature. -4
- **perfect obedience:** Entity obeys all commands without question while still acting independently between orders. -5
- **Complete Automation:** remains completely inert unless stimulated by established triggers or direct prompts. INFLUENCE roll may be required, depending on . -2 onto any level

**How physically present is the entity?**
entity is bound to a specific AOE. EASIER +2
noncorporeal, invisible (can sense as normal, can whisper, but only interact magically) -1
noncorporeal, visible (whispy and ghostlike, can make loud noise, but only interact magically) -3
completely physical -5
