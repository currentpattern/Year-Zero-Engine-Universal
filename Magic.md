# Learning Spells Through Ritual/Study
A more ritualistic method of learning magic powers: harder than learning a skill. Skill rolls involved and time taken and XP. Same XP cost, though maybe as much time taken as a Attribute increase. 

- **XP COST**: The amount of XP spent to learn the spell is determined by the roll of a chosen Accord Skill:  a skill most closely applicable to the magical spell. This represents how the character makes sense of the mechanisms of the magical effect. Characters who come from a background of traditional magic schools may simply have that particular class of magic as a Scholar specialty. These can be used as Accord Skills when crafting a spell from that tradition. The player must describe, in psycho-techno-babble relating to their accord skill, the specific kind of mechanism whereby the spell can happen (imagery as language for the unconscious). The more this mechanism deviates from what is considered possible in consensus reality (“Weirdness”), the more difficult the spell is to weave. **You may then roll the Accord Skill to reduce the initial XP cost. Every Success reduces 1 XP of cost, with a minimum of 1 XP cost. The roll may be pushed, but every pushed Bane increases the cost by 1 XP.**
- **TIME TAKEN**: 2 hours per XP cost. These hours may be broken up, but must all take place within 1 week.
- **ROLL TO LEARN**: Roll to cast the spell UNKNOWN (+4 WL, -4 DM). A success in this case does not result in the casting up the spell (or associated mishap potential), but merely results in deep internalization of it. The roll to learn may also gain bonusses in the following ways:   
	- Exact a PRICE that is not included in the spell itself.  
	- Use an INSTRUMENT that is not included in the spell itself.  
	- Deep research: Every success on 2-hour-Long Scholar: Occult roll grants +2 DM. A failure incurs -2 DM
	- Crafting Ritual Paraphernalia: Every success on a 2-hour-Long Crafting roll to build a ritual space and specialized ritual implements grants +1 DM. 2 of these DMs may be kept long term as reusable ritual space/gear.  
	- Using a ritual space/paraphernalia that you've already crafted: +1 - +2 DM  

# The Lucid Dream State
This is the world of pure imagination, integrated deeply with the highly generative and creative unconscious (preconscious and superconscious). 

**Entering It**
This can be entered through waking meditative states (Insight: Mindful -5 / XXXX), or through sleep-induced lucid dreaming (Scholar: Psychology -1 / XX + at least 3h sleep).

**Half as Restful as Sleep**
Time spent in the Lucid Dream State (LDS) is half as restful as sleep. 
(Every hour spent in Lucid Dream State counts as 30 minutes of sleep).

**A Simulation Space**
Any situation that is needed in order to practice a skill may be generated within the LDS. One cannot train a skill exclusively in the LDS, however. At least half the training must be done in the waking world for a character to actually improve a skill.

# Learning Magical Spells within the Lucid Dream State
Characters can also imagine improbable and impossible things within the LDS. Due to the nature of The City, this actually increases the possibility of creating these events in "waking" life. 

Creating A Spell

1) Determine **Weirdness Level** based on the desired effect. This determines **XP Cost**, as well as base **Difficulty Modifier (DM)*** and base **Casting Time**. -1 weirdness level if target can resist effects through non-magical skill roll. Decide what mundane skill is used in the casting of the spell. This is called the “**Accord Skill.**”
2) For every 3 dice in your Accord skill, add +1 to your Insight: Magic roll for this particular spell. This total now becomes the **Casting Dice** for this spell.
3) Modify the **Casting Time** for the spell
4) Decide **Duration** of the spell.
5) Decide **Range** of the spell. How far away is the point/subject where your spell arises?
6) If the spell usually effects others, the determine the base **Relationship** modifier. Note that you can shift this up or down during gameplay.
7) Total up the Difficulty Modifier. Spend as many hours in the Astral Plane learning the spell as the XP cost. 

### 1) Determining Weirdness Level and Accord Skill
 In order to first acquire a magical spell, the character must spend XP learning it in the Astral Plane. The amount of XP spent to learn the spell is determined by the roll of a chosen Accord Skill:  a skill most closely applicable to the magical spell. This represents how the character makes sense of the mechanisms of the magical effect. Characters who come from a background of traditional magic schools may simply have that particular class of magic as a Scholar specialty. These can be used as Accord Skills when crafting a spell from that tradition. 
 
 The player must describe, in psycho-techno-babble relating to their accord skill, the specific kind of mechanism whereby the spell can happen (imagery as language for the unconscious). The more this mechanism deviates from what is considered possible in consensus reality (“Weirdness”), the more difficult the spell is to weave. You may then roll the Accord Skill to reduce the initial XP cost. Every Success reduces 1 XP of cost, with a minimum of 1 XP cost. The roll may be pushed, but every pushed Bane increases the cost by 1 XP.

**How is it that you're rationalizing the mechanism that makes this possible to your mind? Is it like some sort of advanced science, pseudo-science, or is it fundamentally breaking the laws of physics? Is it creating something out of nothing, or is it manipulating something that's already there? This will directly impact Weirdness Level.**
- **For example, a spell that creates light could be rationalized as 'manipulating existing photons in the air' (lower Weirdness) or as 'creating energy from nothing' (higher Weirdness). A spell that makes someone flee could be 'producing a physical repulsion force' (lower Weirdness) or 'directly controlling their mind' (much higher Weirdness).**


**Special Rules**
There are very few rules for what kind of spells can be created and cast. But there are a few constraints:  
- Spells that **dispel, defend against, or nullify other magic spells** generate a Magical Defense total. This total faces a negative Difficulty Modifier equal to the attacking spell's Weirdness Level, and is then rolled against the attacking caster's successes. Every success on the defense would cancel out successes on a casting.  
- Spells to **increase your skill dice** do not stack. Skill/Talent-improvement spells are ranked in Weirdness based on how much higher the magical bonus is from your normal skill, not a flat +4 (for example) that can be cast multiple times for several +4 bonuses.  
- **Directly altering people's minds** is extremely difficult. Even the smallest mental alteration begins at Weirdness Level 6. Likewise altering your own mind on a fundamental level: Spells to improve EMPATHY attribute or EMPATHY-based skills begin at Weirdness Level 6.  
- **If the Weirdness Level of a desired effect is unclear**, consider the following:  
>>>>1)  If the effect is **Passive** (e.g. +1 armor, +2 str, night vision, magnetic aura, tempurature resistance, +4 stealth, etc), consider a lower WL. If the effect is **Active** (e.g. flame stream, telekenetic control, mind reading, levitation, shape shifting, illusion projection, weather control), consider a higher WL.  
>>>>2)  If the effect is **Momentary** (e.g., explosion of a fireball, healing a wound, dispelling a lock), consider a lower WL. If the effect is **Continuous** (e.g. a personal shield, wall of stone, ongoing mind link, etc), consider a higher WL.

Different spell effects can be categorized by their "Weirdness level," the amount that the effect of the spell deviates from what is considered possible in consensus reality. The subcategories in each level ("die chance", "command energies", etc.) is an arbitrary means of categorizing the types of potential spell effects, and only matter for the purposes of making sense of how a particular spell effect might be categorized into an appropriate Weirdness Level. Organized into each on this table are practical examples of spell effects to give the reader a means or orienting to what the Weirdness Levels mean.

### 2) Casting Dice
Convert all dice rolled for this spell's Accord skill (Attribute + Skill) and your Insight: Magic skill (Wits + Skill) into Base Dice. Add them together into one pool. This total now becomes the **Casting Dice** for this particular spell. This large pool will be heavily modified by the difficulty of the spell. 

### 3) Modify Spell's Casting Time (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
This refers to how long it takes you to cast the spell. There are 8 Increments of Casting Time. The Weirdness Level of the spell introduces Base Casting Time. 

Every increment you make the Casting Time faster = -1 DM

Every increment you make the Casting Time slower = +1 DM

### 4) Spell Duration (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
If the effects of the spell require ongoing magic in order to continue, Spell Duration is required. 

| Duration       | Difficulty Modifier |
| -------------- | :-----------------: |
| Up to 1 round  |          -          |
| Concentration* |         -1          |
| 15 min         |         -2          |
| 1 hour         |         -3          |
| 3h             |         -4          |
| 1 QD           |         -5          |
| 1 day          |         -6          |
| 3 days         |         -7          |
| 9 days         |         -8          |
| 1 month        |         -9          |
| 3 months       |         -10         |
| 9 months       |         -11         |
(Concentration = 1 fast action each round)

**Momentary Effect** (e.g., explosion of a fireball, healing a wound, dispelling a lock) One use, gone. Has an immediate, one-time effect when cast. **Increasing the duration** means you are increasing the time span within which momentary activations may occur. You must decide the **Total Activations** below. If you are instead trying to make a momentary effect last continuously, see "Momentary Effects Made Continuous" below.

**Continuous Effects** (e.g. a personal shield, wall of stone, ongoing mind link, etc) are always "on" unless suppressed or ended. They can be made **Toggleable for -1 DM**, and in addition, you must decide the **Total Activations** below with consequent Difficulty Modifier.

**Momentary Effects Made Continuous** (e.g. ​ Fireball stream, continuous lightning bolt discharge, continuous major healing, continuously phase through matter, liquid-form shapeshifting, continuous earthquake) are substantially more powerful than their momentary versions and increase weirdness level by + 2 WL to +5 WL, depending on GM discretion. This makes them entirely new spells. They are now always "on" unless suppressed or ended. They can be made **Toggleable for -1 DM**, and in addition, you must decide the **Total Activations** below with consequent Difficulty Modifier.

| Total Activations                                | DM  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| One and done. Default for momentary spells.      | +0  |
| Twice. Default for toggleable continuous spells. | -1  |
| 4 per Quarter Day, Max                           | -2  |
| 8 per Quarter Day, Max                           | -3  |
| 16 per Quarter Day, Max                          | -4  |
| 32 per Quarter Day, Max                          | -5  |
| Unlimited                                        | -6  |

### 5) Spell Range (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
How far away is the point/subject where the effect of your spell arises?

| Range                    | Difficulty Modifier |
| ------------------------ | :-----------------: |
| Self                     |          -          |
| Arm's Length<br>up to 3m |         -1          |
| Short<br>up to 10m       |         -2          |
| Medium<br>up to 20m      |         -3          |
| Long<br>up to 100m       |         -4          |
| Distant<br>up to 300m    |         -5          |
| Extreme<br>up to 1km     |         -6          |
| 5km                      |         -8          |
| 10km                     |         -11         |
| 15km                     |         -15         |

| 25km                     |         -26         |
### 6) Relationship / Area of Effect (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
If the spell usually effects others, the determine the base Relationship modifier. If the effect of the spell spreads out over an area, determine base AOE. Note that you can shift this up or down during gameplay. 

| Relationship / Area of Effect                     | Difficulty Modifier |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| self                                              | -                   |

### 8) Total Difficulty Modifier, Spend Time Learning
Total up the Difficulty Modifier.

Spend as many hours in the Astral Plane learning the spell as the XP cost. Name the spell, and record it as follows.

Spell Name: Mechanism. Effect. Weirdness Level. Accord Skill (Casting Dice (assume 20D)-DM=new total), Time, Instrument, Range, Relationship/AOE, Duration. Price

Example: 
*Body Blur: I hum a deep vibrating note and deeply visualize the vibrations expanding through my body. +1 to dodge by creating a vibrating aura. Move: Fast Footwork 6D, 2rnd, Necklace, Arm's L., Self, Concentration


# **CASTING MEMORIZED SPELLS**
**1)** Adjust the Difficulty Modifier by circumstances. Casting time, range, duration, and relationship/AOE can each be adjusted by 1 increment. Use of an **Instrument**, and/or paying a **Price** may allow for larger Difficulty Modifier adjustments.  

**2)** Roll **Casting Dice**. Roleplay/describe the spell’s performance. The roll consists of Base Dice, and can be pushed. Banes after a Push will increase the chances of Mishap.  
  
**3)** **Success** achieves desired effect.  
For every success beyond the first, you may also alter any of the following by one increment: Casting time, Duration, Range, Relationship/AOE.
Failure means the spell fails to occur. GM will roll for mishaps regardless of success or failure. See below.
 Keep track of how many successes you have cast it with. This is in case you face magical opposition- attempts to deflect or nullify your spell. E.g. if a Dispel Magic attempt gains one X, it will cancel out one X of yours, reducing whatever improvements to range, duration or some other element you've implemented.

**4)** **GM rolls for mishaps**. There are 4 factors that impact the chance of a Mishap:  
1. **Weirdness Level**: The more weird or paranormal the spell is, the more chance of mishap. This is the most impactful factor. If a mishap does occur, higher Weirdness Levels will also increase the chances of a *more severe* mishap.  
2. **Duration of Spell**: Spells that last an hour or more have more of a chance of mishap than instant effects.
3. **Success, Failures, and Banes**: A successful spell has a higher chance of mishap than a failure. Each Bane after a pushed roll will strongly increase the chances of a mishap.  
4. **Witnesses / effected persons**: The more people that have witness or have been directly effected by the spell will increase the chances of a mishap, especially more than 7 witnesses/effected.
**Chances**: A successful Weirdness Level 2 spell that lasts 1 round and has no other witnesses or impacted people besides oneself has a 4% chance of Mishap. Weirdness Level 7 or 8 spell that lasts for an hour or more and is witness by or directly effects more than 1,000 people will have a greater than 90% chance of triggering a Mishap. 
**Mishap Severity**: Only 1 factor impacts the severity of a Mishap: Weirdness Level. Mishaps at Weirdness Levels 7 and 8 have a 20%-30% chance of being the most severe possible. Level 3 or below spells have no chance of the most severe mishap.

**Note**: _Increasing Weirdness Level at all_, or _increasing Duration or Range by 2 or more increments_ counts as casting a spell you don’t know.  

### Paying A Price
Psychological sensemaking is a major factor in your PC's abililty to cast a spell. Magic makes more sense if there is a cost that comes with it. So you may choose to add a Price during the spell creation process, or you may choose to pay a Price when casting a spell during play.
**During Spell Creation:** Player chooses which level of Difficulty Modifier bonus they want. Player then rolls 1D8, and the Price of the spell will permanently be what is indicated on the table below. You cannot undo the price without essentially making a new spell.
**Choosing a SPECIFIC Price**: Only during spell creation, you may elect for the price to be a specific, non-random one (e.g. "I want this to have a Stress cost," or "The spell drains my Empathy"), you may do so at the cost of increasing +1 Weirdness Level. This will, in effect, lessen the Price's bonus by 1. 
**Chosen During Play**: The available bonuses for a one-off Price are lower, but player may choose the level of bonus. Player then rolls 1D8, and the Price of that casting will be what is indicated on the table below.


| 1-2                                | 3-4                    | 5-6                | 7-8                      |                                                         |                                  |

# CASTING UNMEMORIZED SPELLS

Not enough time solidifying the imaginative mechanism into the mind.
**+4 Weirdness Level,** as well as an additional -4 Difficulty Modifier. Further difficulty modifiers are based off of the 

# GROUP CASTING

1) **Pick a Lead caster**.
2)  **Combine everyone's Casting Dice** for the spell into a total Casting Dice Pool.
3) **If a caster is using a different Accord Skill** for the spell than the Lead caster, -1 DM if their Accord Skill (specialization doesn't matter) is at least under the same Attribute as the Lead Caster's Accord Skill. If the skill is under a different Attribute, -2 DM.  
>>>> E.g. Lead caster's Accord Skill is Scholar: Path of Healing (a WITS skill). An assistant's Accord Skill is Medical Aid (an EMPATHY skill). -2 DM from the assistant's contribution to the Casting Dice Pool.
4) **For every success beyond the first**, you may also alter any of the following by one increment: Casting time, Duration, Activations, Range, Relationship/AOE.
5) **For calculating Mishaps**, use the highest Weirdness Level present (i.e. if a caster doesn't Know the spell +4 WL)

# MISHAPS
- Every time you cast a spell, there is some chance of a Mishap
- There are 5 factors that impact the probability:
	- Weirdness Level: higher = higher probability
	- Spell Duration: Longer = higher probability, although the chances do not increase after 1 hour of duration.
	- Casting Success: Failure has lower chance than success, though multiple successes actually decrease mishap probability again.
	- Banes after a push: Every bane present after a push notably increases the probability of mishap
	- Number of witnesses/ affected persons: Even if someone is directly impacted by magic without them being aware of it. Scales logarithmically.
- There are at least 4 levels of Mishap severity. Only Weirdness Level influences probability of severity levels, but this caps out at WL 6. The higher WL typically involve the arrival of "agents/MIB/Guardians," arriving between 5 seconds to 5 minutes.
