## Learning Magical Spells within The Astral Plane
Characters can also imagine improbable and impossible things within the AP. Due to the nature of The City, this actually increases the possibility of creating these events in "waking" life. 

Creating A Spell

1) Determine **Weirdness Level** based on the desired effect. This determines **XP Cost**, as well as base **Difficulty Modifier (DM)*** and base **Casting Time**. -1 weirdness level if target can resist effects through non-magical skill roll. Decide what mundane skill is used in the casting of the spell. This is called the “**Accord Skill.**”
2) For every 3 dice in your Accord skill, add +1 to your Insight: Magic roll for this particular spell. This total now becomes the **Casting Dice** for this spell.
3) Modify the **Casting Time** for the spell
4) Decide **Duration** of the spell.
5) Decide **Range** of the spell. How far away is the point/subject where your spell arises?
6) If the spell usually effects others, the determine the base **Relationship** modifier. Note that you can shift this up or down during gameplay.
7) Total up the Difficulty Modifier. Spend as many hours in the Astral Plane learning the spell as the XP cost. 

### 1) Determining Weirdness Level and Accord Skill
 In order to first acquire a magical spell, the character must spend XP learning it in the Astral Plane. The amount of XP spent to learn the spell is determined by the roll of a chosen Accord Skill:  a skill most closely applicable to the magical spell. This represents how the character makes sense of the mechanisms of the magical effect. Characters who come from a background of traditional magic schools may simply have that particular class of magic as a Scholar specialty. These can be used as Accord Skills when crafting a spell from that tradition. 
 
 The player must describe, in psycho-techno-babble relating to their accord skill, the specific kind of mechanism whereby the spell can happen (imagery as language for the unconscious). The more this mechanism deviates from what is considered possible in consensus reality (“Weirdness”), the more difficult the spell is to weave. You may then roll the Accord Skill to reduce the initial XP cost. Every Success reduces 1 XP of cost, with a minimum of 1 XP cost. The roll may be pushed, but every pushed Bane increases the cost by 1 XP.

**"When creating your spell, I need you to explain the specific mechanism through which your magic achieves its effect. This isn't just flavor text—it directly impacts the spell's Weirdness Level and difficulty.**
**Tell me:**
1. **What exactly is your magic manipulating? (Energy, matter, perception, time, space, minds, etc.)**
2. **How does your spell interact with reality to create its effect? Is it altering physical properties, creating something new, affecting perception, or something else?**
3. **Could this effect be rationalized as advanced technology or science, or does it fundamentally break the laws of reality?**
**For example, a spell that creates light could be rationalized as 'manipulating existing photons in the air' (lower Weirdness) or as 'creating energy from nothing' (higher Weirdness). A spell that makes someone flee could be 'producing a physical repulsion force' (lower Weirdness) or 'directly controlling their mind' (much higher Weirdness)."**


**Special Rules**
There are very few rules for what kind of spells can be created and cast. But there are a few constraints:
- Spells that **dispel, defend against, or nullify other magic spells** generate a Magical Defense total. This total faces a negative Difficulty Modifier equal to the attacking spell's Weirdness Level, and is then rolled against the attacking caster's successes. Every success on the defense would cancel out successes on a casting.
- Spells to **increase your skill dice** do not stack. Skill/Talent-improvement spells are ranked in Weirdness based on how much higher the magical bonus is from your normal skill, not a flat +4 (for example) that can be cast multiple times for several +4 bonuses.
- **Directly altering people's minds** is extremely difficult. Even the smallest mental alteration begins at Weirdness Level 6. Likewise altering your own mind on a fundamental level: Spells to improve EMPATHY attribute or EMPATHY-based skills begin at Weirdness Level 6.

| Weirdness Level                                                                                                                                                                          | Base XP Cost | Base Difficulty Modifier | Base Casting Time |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1. Subtle (unnoticeable by others, with naturalistic effects, effects that could be explained away as coincidence or skill)                                                              | 1            | -2                       | Fast Action       |
| 2. Noticeable (Could be mundane trickery, believable but noteworthy, effects that are clearly unusual but not obviously supernatural)                                                    | 2            | -3                       | Slow Action       |
| 3. Weird (Very strange, possibly pseudo-scientific, effects that begin to defy mundane explanation but could be rationalized as advanced technology or results of unknown science)       | 3            | -4                       | 2 Rounds          |
| 4. Paranormal (Obviously incredible. Strains one's notion of reality, effects that clearly demonstrate supernatural power but remain within human superstitious understanding.)          | 4            | -5                       | 1 Minute          |
| 5. Fantastic (Defies common sense but aligns with magical or fantastical logic, effects that openly challenge the laws of physics and mundane reality)                                   | 5            | -6                       | 15 Min            |
| 6. Mindblowing (Overwhelms the mind with sheer impossibility, radically altering perception, effects that completely transcend normal physical limitations and begin to reshape reality) | 6            | -7                       | 1 Hour            |
| 7. Legendary (Transcendent, bordering on mythic and capable of becoming legend, effects that fundamentally alter reality on a significant scale)                                         | 7            | -8                       | 3 Hours           |
| 8. Impossible (Makes absolutely no sense in any real world, effects that fundamentally rewrite the laws of reality)                                                                      | 8            | -9                       | 1 Quarter Day     |
Different spell effects can be categorized by their "Weirdness level," the amount that the effect of the spell deviates from what is considered possible in consensus reality. The subcategories in each level ("die chance", "command energies", etc.) is an arbitrary means of categorizing the types of potential spell effects, and only matter for the purposes of making sense of how a particular spell effect might be categorized into an appropriate Weirdness Level. Organized into each on this table are practical examples of spell effects to give the reader a means or orienting to what the Weirdness Levels mean.

### 2) Casting Dice
Convert all dice rolled for this spell's Accord skill (Attribute + Skill) and your Insight: Magic skill (Wits + Skill) into Base Dice. Add them together into one pool. This total now becomes the **Casting Dice** for this particular spell. This large pool will be heavily modified by the difficulty of the spell. 

### 3) Modify Spell's Casting Time (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
This refers to how long it takes you to cast the spell. There are 8 Increments of Casting Time. The Weirdness Level of the spell introduces Base Casting Time. 

Every increment you make the Casting Time faster = -1 DM

Every increment you make the Casting Time slower = +1 DM



### 4) Spell Duration (May be shifted by 1 increment in game)
If the effects of the spell require ongoing magic in order to continue, Spell Duration is required.

| Acquiring or creating the instrument<br>required a roll at -3, or with XXX | +1                  |     |


### 8) Total Difficulty Modifier, Spend Time Learning
Total up the Difficulty Modifier.

Spend as many hours in the Astral Plane learning the spell as the XP cost. Name the spell, and record it as follows.

Spell Name: Mechanism. Effect. Weirdness Level. Accord Skill (Casting Dice (assume 20D)-DM=new total), Time, Instrument, Range, Relationship/AOE, Duration. Price

Example: 
*Body Blur: I hum a deep vibrating note and deeply visualize the vibrations expanding through my body. +1 to dodge by creating a vibrating aura. Move: Fast Footwork 6D, 2rnd, Necklace, Arm's L., Self, Concentration


# **CASTING MEMORIZED SPELLS**
**1)** Adjust the Difficulty Modifier by circumstances. Casting time, range, duration, and relationship/AOE can each be adjusted by 1 increment. Use of an **Instrument**, and/or paying a **Price** may allow for larger Difficulty Modifier adjustments.  

**2)** Roll **Casting Dice**. Roleplay/describe the spell’s performance. The roll consists of Base Dice, and can be pushed. Banes after a Push will increase the chances of Mishap.  
  
**3)** **Success** achieves desired effect.  
For every success beyond the first, you may also alter any of the following by one increment: Casting time, Duration, Range, Relationship/AOE.
Failure means the spell fails to occur. GM will roll for mishaps regardless of success or failure. See below.
 Keep track of how many successes you have cast it with. This is in case you face magical opposition- attempts to deflect or nullify your spell. E.g. if a Dispel Magic attempt gains one X, it will cancel out one X of yours, reducing whatever improvements to range, duration or some other element you've implemented.

**4)** **GM rolls for mishaps**. There are 4 factors that impact the chance of a Mishap:  
1. **Weirdness Level**: The more weird or paranormal the spell is, the more chance of mishap. This is the most impactful factor. If a mishap does occur, higher Weirdness Levels will also increase the chances of a *more severe* mishap.  
2. **Duration of Spell**: Spells that last an hour or more have more of a chance of mishap than instant effects.
3. **Success, Failures, and Banes**: A successful spell has a higher chance of mishap than a failure. Each Bane after a pushed roll will strongly increase the chances of a mishap.  
4. **Witnesses / effected persons**: The more people that have witness or have been directly effected by the spell will increase the chances of a mishap, especially more than 7 witnesses/effected.
**Chances**: A successful Weirdness Level 2 spell that lasts 1 round and has no other witnesses or impacted people besides oneself has a 4% chance of Mishap. Weirdness Level 7 or 8 spell that lasts for an hour or more and is witness by or directly effects more than 1,000 people will have a greater than 90% chance of triggering a Mishap. 
**Mishap Severity**: Only 1 factor impacts the severity of a Mishap: Weirdness Level. Mishaps at Weirdness Levels 7 and 8 have a 20%-30% chance of being the most severe possible. Level 3 or below spells have no chance of the most severe mishap.

**Note**: _Increasing Weirdness Level at all_, or _increasing Duration or Range by 2 or more increments_ counts as casting a spell you don’t know.  

### Paying A Price
Psychological sensemaking is a major factor in your PC's abililty to cast a spell. Magic makes more sense if there is a cost that comes with it. So you may choose to add a Price during the spell creation process, or you may choose to pay a Price when casting a spell during play.
**During Spell Creation:** Player chooses which level of Difficulty Modifier bonus they want. Player then rolls 1D8, and the Price of the spell will permanently be what is indicated on the table below. You cannot undo the price without essentially making a new spell.
**Chosen During Play**: The available bonuses for a one-off Price are lower, but player may choose the level of bonus. Player then rolls 1D8, and the Price of that casting will be what is indicated on the table below.

| 1-2                                | 3-4                    | 5-6                | 7-8                      |                                                         |                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | :-----------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| **Accord Attribute Damage**        | **Mishap Probability** | **Willpower Cost** | **Stress Cost**          | **Difficulty Modifier if chosen during Spell Creation** | **DM if chosen <br>during play** |
