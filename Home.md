TO DO
healing trauma points: perhaps it is some Roleplaying interaction with things like Pride, dark secret, etc.


**Willpower**
Banes rolled on pushed Base Dice cause 1 damage to the relevant attribute and earn 1 WP per bane. WP may be spent in the following ways:
- Convert 1 WP to 1 XP for the purpose of training skills
- Ignore suppression
- +1D per WP (max 4 per round). These can be granted to a fellow character if you are helping. 
- Re-rolling a critical damage result (once per injury)
- Remove 2 Stress Points? Before GM calls for Panic roll.
- Buying success
-
#### What's cool from what?

War Stories p 115- **Damage to Structures**
War Stories p80 - **Make a Plan**. Characters w/in earshot may collectively give up a Slow Action when their turn comes. Character with the highest Influence (command) skill rolls. If successful, in the following round, the characters who participated may take all of their available actions in any order on any initiative slot rolled by one of the characters in the participating group. 
War Stories- p18. **Full Auto fire** requires both fast and short actions
War Stores- **Move** 10m is Fast Action, move 20m is Slow Action. Can be combined to go 30m, but must roll Movement
War Stories- **All or one of your dodge successes may be provided to an ally.**
Alien- p74. **Site invesitgation** rules
Alien-  **Piloting, Accelerate and Decelerate Actions**
T2K- Ammo Dice

Suppression: 
	1) getting hit by a firearm, or X on ammo dice, or in explosion blast zone = roll CUF+unit morale (Insight: Calm)
	2) Failed CUF = Suppressed: Seek cover (prone, etc), gain 1 stress, lose next slow action. All allies w/in 10m roll CUF
		War Stories: Lose next Slow Action. Must seek &/or remain in cover. May move away from perceived danger, but not towards it. 


IDEA: Dodging firearms beyond a certain range is not possible.
Why? Suppression simulates a full dodge; throwing yourself behind cover, and it is necessarily reactive. If you dodged first, THEN suppressed, you'd lose next FAST and SLOW actions.
LOOK UP:
	Dodging in War Stories. 
		Can you dodge firearms? 
			If you are the target of a Ranged Attack (including grenades, heavy weapons, or Tech-based ranged attacks) and are aware of the attack, you have two options to try to avoid getting hit: you may spend your Fast Action to Hit the Dirt (go Prone) or Take Cover (provided some exists within 10m). You must elect to take either option before your opponent rolls the Ranged Attack test!
PRONE: -1D from attack.
		What happens if you dodge and then are suppressed?
	Dodging in T2K.
		Can you dodge firearms? Fast action to “Seek cover” (not a reaction) ((without reading about this: Instead of a dodge, a fast action reaction could be used to immediately impose a challenge to the attacker: prone, cover, etc)).
Fast Action (when cover is available in 10m): FULL COVER; block los, and full body protection. -3 to hit IF attacker knows approx location. PARTIAL COVER; exposing head & arms, rest is covered by “armor” now.
FULL -> PARTIAL = fast action
PARTIAL -> FULL = free action on turn
Moving Target: If target has moved since your last turn, -1 to hit. I.e. allows proactive dodging.


ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY
Perhaps instead of triggering on retreat, trigger on first entering an enemy's weapon range

EXTRA SUCCESSES
extra successes can do extra things such as breaking Shields or penetrating armor things that would be unusual to actually attempt

**GM THREAT POINTS**
Adding GM Threat points for each push.  
- An event occurs to damage their stats  
-An event occurs to damage their gear  
-changing the environement to add difficulty  
-adding dice to opposing NPC's rolls  
-weapon misfiring  
-you dropping something  
-Turn a success into a mixed success / complication  
2D20's uses:  
-buy off an NPC complication: 2 Threat Points  
-Negative complication coming directly from situation: 2 Threat Points  
-NPC Reinforcements: 1 TP for minor NPCs, 2 TP for Notable NPCs  
War Stories uses:  
- NPC push a roll  
- Re-roll a Damage Roll.  
- Change a minor Plot Point (ex: environmental effect, innocent bystander, personal problem, lost possession)  
- Impose a narratively appropriate Condition (without END loss) onto an Attribute. Only one Condition, per PC, may be imposed at a time.  
- Random Bad Luck Event: The cost for this may vary from 1 to 3 FUBARs. The higher the cost, the more unlucky the event. These might include anything from an unexpected enemy appearing to friendly fire targeting the players or an artillery barrage landing close enough to affect the PCs. (2 FUBAR to mishap a RELIABLE item)

**TALENTS TO DIFFICULTIES**

| Rank | DN         |
| ---- | ---------- |
| 1    | -2 / XX    |
| 2    | -3 / XXX   |
| 3    | -4 / XXX   |
| 4    | -5 / XXXX  |
| 5    | -7 / XXXXX |


**MEDITATION**
Skill Conversion:
Insight: Mindful is the specialization
Every rank a PC had of Meditation talent goes into the Mindful specialization.
e.g. Alyssum had Wits+Insight: 9, and Meditation: 6
	Her Insight: Mindful is 15. If she tries to enter astral plane from waking (-5), she rolls 10D.
