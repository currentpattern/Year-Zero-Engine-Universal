**MAGIC**
**Telekenesis**, Levitate target 15m/round
	cast 2 rounds, 20m range, Concentration, 1 nonfriend
	Target up to Medium range is lifted 1–3 meters off the ground and can be moved up to 10 meters per round in a chosen direction, including being slammed into walls or dropped. Treat as a grapple you control; each round you sustain, you may reposition or slam for 1 damage (count as blunt/force). Target may resist each round with a relevant physical skill (Move, Force, or equivalent) at GM’s call.
**Bullet Phase**
	Cast slow action, 1 round
	Until the end of the round after casting, ranged physical attacks against the Agent suffer a large penalty (e.g., equivalent to a -2 or -3 DM to hit, or impose Disadvantage depending on your chassis), and the Agent may automatically ignore the first successful ranged hit that would affect them that round. Does not improve their skills; it is a binary protection/negation effect.
**Impossible Dash WL 3**
	Cast slow action, 40m, Instant
	Instantly move up to 40m as if taking a Move action that ignores intervening obstacles up to chest height and narrow gaps (ducking, sliding, bouncing off walls). Treat as supernatural movement: not flight, but the Agent can cross open kill-zones or get behind an enemy in a blur. Cannot pass through solid walls or locked doors thicker than a narrow gap. May combine with one melee attack at the destination with a small penalty if you want it to feel like an aggressive “lunge”.
**Structural Rewrite, WL 3**
	Cast slow action, 10m range, Instant, 
	Target a piece of cover, a door, a vehicle component, or a single held/worn object within Short–Medium range. You may:
	- Shatter or twist it (destroy cover, jam a gun, lock a car door by welding its mechanism, collapse a stairway step).
    - Or weaponize it: cause a sudden burst of fragments for 1–2 damage in a small zone or knock a target prone as their footing gives out.  
    Objects can resist with an effective “armor” or structural rating if you track that; living beings resist normally if they are the direct target (e.g., trying to crush armor into them rather than just breaking the armor).
**Detect and Delete Magic**
	- the agents are alerted to Magic occurring within a 20 m diameter. Caster is situated at a random point within a 20 M search area.
	- active spells, if they come within 10 m that spell rolls for mishap at +4 weirdness level. Spell is visible and obvious, they can tell on site. If they come within arms length, it is automatically detected.
	- inactive spells, spell had been cast since the triggering mishap, including that mishap, roll for mishap if they are within 10 m of the spell origin. Mishap at weirdest level plus four if they come within arms range.
	- once detected, they can shut down any spell at any range with a slow action. When a magic user is detected, they will respond as if homeland security has identified a terrorist. First, arrest at gunpoint. If successful, hands on head for two full rounds retcons the individual from existence and places them into a new life. If this fails, they resort to shooting the individual, with a reset upon death.
**AGENT EARPIECES CHATTER**  
	1. **Background Status Ping**
	As they move through a corridor or street in Level 7, just say.
	    “In your ears, a faint, overlapping murmur clicks on for the first time. A flat voice:
	    ‘Routine integrity check. No active anomalies in sector seven. Maintain idle watch.’ Then static, and silence.”
	They did nothing; clearly the line woke up on its own. If they talk into the earpiece, you can give them no reply (it’s one-way), but now they know it carries live traffic.
	2. **Someone Else’s Mishap, Far Away**
	Have the channel light up about an event somewhere else.
	    “You hear: ‘Correction Sweep authorized in Midtown grid. Minor deviation: traffic pattern inconsistency. Auto-smooth and resume.’ It sounds distant and uninterested in wherever you are right now.”
	No Agents show up; it’s just a weather report from the immune system. That teaches them the vocabulary without putting them at risk.
	3. **Distant Area Scan / Agent Recall**
	Give them a fuller, but still remote, exchange:
	    “Earpieces crackle: ‘Area Scan complete. Anomaly reclassified as dream residue. Cancel Agent dispatch. Return to default patrol.’ Another voice: ‘Acknowledged. Standing down.’”
	Again, nothing happens locally, reinforcing that they are only listening in.
