# SCROUNGING
The Streets or Ruins might seem strewn with junk, but to the trained eye, there are small treasures everywhere. If you spend a Quarter Day SCROUNGING in the 1-km^2 hex (in a city/ruin) or 10km^2 hex (in the countryside) you currently occupy, you have a chance to find useful scrap.  

Roll for SURVIVAL: Scrounger, modified for the terrain type. For each X you get, roll D100 on [the scrap table](the%20scrap%20table.md). The table lists any effect the item has. The Value column indicated the approximate value of the item, **in bullets**. The Spare Parts column indicates how many spare parts can be scavenged from the find. Scavenging Spare Parts  (weapon, vehicle, electronic, general) from found items takes a full Quarter Day, separate from the time spent scrounging. Only one character can roll for scrounging in the same hex during the same Quarter Day, but others can help the roll. For each time you scrounge again in the same hex, you get a –1 cumulative modifier. 

GM’S CHOICE: The GM can decide what item you find when scrounging, instead of letting you roll. The Referee can also ask you for a re-roll, for example if you find the same item twice in a row.

QUICK SEARCH
Sometimes, you might want to make a quick search for scrap in a smaller area, without spending a full Quarter Day. The GM should only allow this in areas where there is likely to be scrap present, such as a settlement of some kind. A quick search requires no dice roll, and gives you a free roll on the scrap table. This does not count as scrounging, and you can still spend the main part of the shift doing something else. You can also still scrounge the hex you’re in, even after a quick search.
