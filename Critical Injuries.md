**A homebrew on wound infections:**
Every critical injury in the Slash and Stab tables also becomes infected with a disease severity equal to the rolled healing time. It's completely ignored if the wound is cared for (sucessful Healing roll to halve the healing time) before the infection kicks in, as diseases start the day after infection.
The injury Ruptured Intestines also had its effect changed to +3 to its infection severity.
