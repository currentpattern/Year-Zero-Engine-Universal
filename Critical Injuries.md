When you take Critical Damage (Strength or Wits being BROKEN from something other than a PUSH), **roll D12 -2** on the table relevant to the latest form of damage you have suffered.  
**For every point of damage beyond what was needed to BREAK you, +2** to the rolled result.

**Willpower Points:** You may spend a WP to re-roll a critical damage result (once per injury), but you must use the new result.

**WOUND INFECTIONS:**
Every critical injury in the Slash and Stab tables also becomes infected with a disease severity equal to the rolled healing time. It's completely ignored if the wound is cared for before the infection kicks in (successful Healing roll to halve the healing time), since diseases start the day after infection.
The injury Ruptured Intestines also had its effect changed to +3 to its infection severity.
