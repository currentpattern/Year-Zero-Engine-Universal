### **ROUNDS & INITIATIVE**

When a conflict begins, the first step is to determine who has the initiative. Do this before anyone rolls dice for an action.

Roll 2d6, and read the results as a 2-digit number. Highest acts before lowest, and ties have a roll-off.

When all the participants in the combat have acted once, the round is over, and a new round begins. The round order remains the same throughout the whole conflict – drawing the initiative is only done once, at the start of the first round.

**ROUNDS & TURNS**  
In the game, a round can represent any period from 5 seconds up to a minute, depending on circumstances and the skills used. Another term used to keep track of time in the game is the turn. A turn is about 15 minutes long, and it is used primarily when exploring adventure sites

**SURPRISE**  
If you perform an attack that the GM deems surprising, you may roll initiative twice, and choose which one of the two rolls you want.

**TALENTS**  
Some talents also allow you to affect your initiative.

**CHANGING THE INITIATIVE**  
You never roll new initiative during a fight, but you can exchange your initiative – and thus your initiative for the round – with another player character. This can be done at the start of the fight or at the start of the round, but never during a round. You and the other player character must be able to speak to each other to exchange initiatives. You can exchange initiatives with an enemy through the FEINT action (see Close Combat).

### **SLOW ACTIONS & FAST ACTIONS**

When it is your turn to act, without incurring an action penalty, you can perform one slow action and one fast action, or two fast actions. You may perform more actions than limited here (except for MOVE), but every FAST ACTION over the limit adds a -1 penalty and every SLOW ACTION over the limit adds a -2 penalty. Some Talents may increase this limit. This penalty is cumulative for the round and resets to 0 when your turn ends
A slow action usually consists of rolling for a skill. A fast action is quicker and doesn’t always require a dice roll, but can do so. See the lists of typical slow and fast actions on the next page. How these work is explained in detail in the sections Close Combat and Ranged Combat.

### **ZONES & RANGES**

The combat area is divided into zones. A zone is a room or an area of ground. How big a zone is varies – from a few steps across up to about 25 meters. A zone is generally smaller in difficult terrain than in open terrain. The distance from one zone to the next is called one segment.

**ZONE FEATURES**  
Zones can have various features, which affect actions performed in the zone.

CRAMPED: The zone is small and/or has a low ceiling. Attacks with HEAVY weapons get a –2 penalty, and it is impossible to SWING WEAPON before a close combat attack.

ROUGH: You must roll MOVE when you RUN into the zone. Failure means you managed to get into the zone, but you fall down.

OPEN: The zone is open and flat, which is ideal for mounted combatants. Read more below.

DARK/FOGGY: Ranged attacks into the zone are modified by –2 and can’t pass through the zone.

**RANGE CATEGORIES**  
In conflict, the distance between you and your opponent is divided into five range categories. See the table on this page. The Typical Terrain column lists the types of terrain where the maximum line-of-sight usually matches that category.

| Range                    | Shooting <br>Modification | Sneak Attack/Ambush<br> Modification |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Arm's Length<br>up to 2m | -2 (*)                    | -2                                   |
| Short<br>up to 10m       | -                         | -1                                   |
| Medium<br>up to 20m      | -1                        | -                                    |
| Long<br>up to 100m       | -2                        | +1                                   |
| Extreme<br>up to 300m    | -3                        | +2                                   |
(*) Small-arms like pistols, sawed-off shotguns, SMGs, and light crossbows are modified by only -1 at Arm's Length

AIM: Fast action. Before you SHOOT, you can AIM. This gives you a +1 bonus to the attack. You must AIM and SHOOT in the same round – you cannot save the bonus for a later round. Please note that you cannot READY your weapon, AIM and SHOOT in the same round, as that is a total of three actions. It’s possible if you have the FAST SHOOTER talent, however.  
You can’t AIM at an aware opponent at ARM’S LENGTH – he is too close for you to be able to draw a bead on.
Note the difference between AIMing and making a "Called Shot." Called shots suffer at least a -2 penalty, and strike chosen locations. You could, however AIM when making a called shot, making the called shot more likely to hit.

CHARGE ATTACK: Move from 10m to Engaged (fast action) then performing a SLASH, STAB, PUNCH, or SHOVE (slow action). This combination is recognized in order to give the Charger specialization a die bonus.

COMMAND: INFLUENCE roll. Fast Action. These are a range of possible uses of the INFLUENCE skill to grant allies an extra edge in the heat of battle. You may either choose a specific effect (and take the appropriate difficulty modifier), or roll without penalty and achieve the appropriate number of successes.

| **"Make a Plan."** You begin to organize a plan with any allies within 20m. All willing participants must collectively give up a Slow Action when their turn comes.

Any ally within 20m who acts in pursuit of that order can add a d8 to one roll. 1 extra Command success increases that bonus to D10. 2 extra Command successes increases that bonus to D12                                                                                                                                                   | -3 / XXX  |
| **Hustle!:** Allowing one **ally within 20m to take a free fast action.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | -3 / XXX  |
| **Rally**. When allies within 10m range are Broken from a FEAR attack, negate the horror critical, but they remain Broken. Every extra success can reduce an ally Broken from FEAR to 1 Wits instead of them being Broken.                                                                                                                                          | -4 / XXX  |
| **On the Double!**: Allowing an 20m range **ally to take a free slow action**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | -5 / XXXX |

DEFEND OTHER: MOVE or PARRY roll. Fast Action. Reactive Action. When attempting a Defend Other action, you may either choose an intended effect (inflicting a negative modifier), or roll without modifier, and attempt to roll the appropriate number of successes. 

| DEFEND OTHER Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | DM        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| **Protective Parry**. When a friend within 10m range is attacked, you may PARRY the attack for him. Your PARRY follows the normal rules and counts as one of your actions in the round. Any unparried damage continues to the intended target, not you.                              | -3 / XX   |
| **Bodily Replace**. Immediately switch places with an ally within 10m engaged in battle. The movement can’t be made through walls or in other ways that would break the laws of physics. Does not count as an action for your ally.                                                  | -4 / XXX  |
| **Body Block**. You may attempt this action at any time, throwing yourself in front of an ally within 10m distance who is being attacked, and suffer 1 damage instead of your friend. If successful, you may add Willpower points, taking on 1 more damage for every Willpower used. | -5 / XXXX |
DISARM: You try to knock the weapon from your opponent’s hands. Roll MELEE and your weapon’s Gear Bonus vs the opponent's MIGHT. An opponent wielding a 2-Handed weapon grants them +2 to their MIGHT roll. If you succeed, your opponent drops their weapon, which lands at ARM’S LENGTH. Any excess X have no effect. You cannot DISARM a shield. Your enemy can PARRY or DODGE your DISARM.

DODGE: You throw yourself out of the way of your opponent’s melee or ranged attack. Fast action, Reactive action. Roll MOVE. You cannot use a weapon. If the attacker SLASHES, you get a +2 bonus. Every X you roll eliminates a X from the attacker’s roll. When you DODGE, you fall prone. You can choose to remain standing, at the cost of a –2 penalty. If you remain standing and you've negated all damage with a -3 penalty, OR roll XX beyond all damage negation, you may at the same time move 10m. Acrobatic flip!

DIVING DODGE: You dive from danger. This takes you out of combat-range, and you land prone. Roll MOVE +2. You can take no more actions during the round (or next round if a reaction) besides stand up, and the dodge counts against all attacks made on you during this duration.  
.  
This in effect makes 3 kinds of dodging:  
1) Dodge -2 vs 1 attack, remain standing  
2) Dodge vs 1 attack, fall prone  
3) Dodge +2 vs all attacks, fall prone, out of arm’s reach, take no actions (besides stand) next round if it’s a reaction.

FAST KIP: Move -5. Allows you to get up from prone position without spending an action. If successful, you are standing, and may now perform a Kick as a Fast Action. Failure means you've used a Fast Action, and remain on the ground.

READ ENEMY: INSIGHT roll, Fast action. -3 / XXX. Foresee how one opponent will act in the coming round. All your attack and defense rolls against this opponent get a +1 modification until it is your turn again in the next round. Every success beyond what is needed grants an additional +1 modification. 

SWING WEAPON: A Fast action that must be performed directly before a SLASH or STAB, in the same round. You swing your HEAVY melee weapon to make your upcoming strike more powerful. No roll is required, and grants your next successful strike +1 damage
You may optionally perform a "Mighty Swing" by roll MIGHT during this action. The result of successes can be varied. Refer to the table below for effects, which may be intended (1 success, including the appropriate modifier), or lucky (no modifiers, but you've rolled the appropriate number of successes). Note that if you roll MIGHT with no modifiers, 1 success has no effect.

| **Extra Damage:** Replace the +1 damage bonus with the rolled result. Gain a +2 bonus to the Might roll if you use both hands.                                                                                       | -2 / XX    |
| **Disrupt Parry:** Opponents suffer a penalty to parry your swing weapon attacks equal to the number of hands you are holding it with.                                                                               | -3 / XXX   |
| **Attack Weapon:** Any item that parries your swing or slash attacks takes 1 damage per three negated successes. Reduce the required amount by 1 if using both hands or if the parrying weapon is weaker than metal. | -4 / XXX   |
| **Armor Pierce:** Any non-natural armor takes 1 extra automatic damage from your swing weapon attack.                                                                                                                | -5 / XXXX  |
| **Wirlwind:** If you down an enemy with a swing weapon attack, you may perform a free run action and repeat the attack as a free action.                                                                             | -7 / XXXXX |

TACKLE: Slow Action. Melee -3 / XXX. Tackle an opponent within 10m range to the ground. If the opponent’s Strength is higher than yours, he can make a MIGHT roll (not an action) to stay on his feet. You both drop what you’re holding, both on ground, they’re now considered GRAPPLED. No effect on creatures with STR 8+.

WARRIOR'S VOICE: Slow action. INFLUENCE: Performance. Through song, cries, biting remarks, and unearthly wails, your voice inspires your comrades and strikes rage and distraction into the minds of your enemies. You may either intentionally choose which effect you're doing, and achieve 1 success (incurring an appropriate Difficulty Modifier), or roll without penalty, and choose the effect based on how many successes you've rolled. Consult the table of effects below.

| Warrior's Voice Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | DM         |

| **Taunt Enemies:** Roll an opposed roll for INFLUENCE versus INSIGHT. The enemy must be within 20m and be able to understand your language. You cannot taunt monsters or animals. If you succeed, choose one of the following effects:  <br>- The enemy is angered and must direct their next attack at you, if at all possible.   <br>- The enemy is distracted and his next roll is modified by –1. If you roll more x than you initially needed to win, the enemy’s next roll is modified by an additional –1 for every x. | -0 / X     |
| **Heartening Warcry:** Emit a **warcry that grants a bonus** all your comrades within 20m to all attacks during one round, until it’s your turn to act again in the next round.

### **Stress**
Stressful experiences, such as getting shot at or witnessing harrowing scenes, can temporarily put you out of action or even cause long term psychological damage. A summary of the stress rules is this:
1) Certain mild-moderately stressful events cause you to gain Stress Points
2) Certain very shocking events cause you to roll Insight (Calm) to avoid Panicking. It's more difficult the more Stress Points you have.
3) Panicking means you roll on a Panic Effect table, and add the number of Stress Points. Worse effects occur the more Stress Points you have.

**Gaining Stress**
You can gain +1 (or more) stress points in several different ways:
- Suffering damage to any attribute. Each point of damage (including after BANES on pushed rolls) accrues +1 stress.
- Getting ==Suppressed== (see below)
- Firing a firearm on full-auto mode (not sure about this)
- Gaining the conditions Hungry, Tired, Thirsty, or Cold 
- perform a Coup de Grace
- An ally attacks you
- Encountering frightening creatures or situations
- Seeing a friend suffer a lethal critical injury (+2)
- witnessing a massacre (+3) 
- being tortured (+3)

**Getting Suppressed**: Another way of gaining stress is getting hit by or receiving very close misses by firearm attacks, or being in the blast zone of an explosion. Suppression triggers your automatic instinct to seek cover.
If you are:
- Hit by a firearm
- Targeted (and missed) by firearm but the enemy Ammo Dice rolls an X 
- In the blast radius of an explosion
- 10m and line of sight from a Suppressed ally
- Inside a vehicle that is ==penetrated by an attack==

Then you must succeed on an INSIGHT (Calm) roll (not an action) to avoid being SUPPRESSED:
- +1 stress
- Immediately ==Seek Cover== (fast action) and/or remain in cover. 
- Lose next Slow Action.
- Next round, move away from perceived danger or stay put, but not towards it. 
- All allies within 10m and line of sight must roll to avoid becoming suppressed.

**Psychological/Fear attacks**: When a character succeeds in an INFLUENCE attempt, every success beyond the first one may (if they choose) add +1 Stress Point to the target. Beyond the second success, a success may (if they choose) trigger a Panic Check in the target.
*Example*: You roll 4 successes vs your target's 0 success. You now have 3 successes beyond the first. You may inflict up to +3 Stress Points, or up +2 Stress Points and a Panic Check.

**Panicking**
Eventually, stressful events will bring you to your breaking point. When that happens, there’s a chance that you’ll lose control and Panic. You determine this by making a **Panic Check**. There are many conditions that trigger a Panic Check:
- Your WITS or EMPATHY is reduced to zero.
- Witness an ally suffering from a certain panic effect (scream, flee, berserk)
- Witness your ==Anchor== suffer any Panic Effect
- You are Suppressed for the 3rd turn in a row.
- You suffer a Critical Injury
- Your ==Anchor== suffers a critical injury
- You're attacked by a strange creature you've never seen before
- A truly horrifying event occurs 
- Witnessing more than 1 ally Panic at the same time
- Seeing a friend die
- When death seems certain

Panic Check: roll INSIGHT (Calm), with a penalty depending on how many stress points you have;

| Stress Points | INSIGHT penalty |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 0-2           | 0               |
| 3-4           | -1              |
| 5-6           | -2              |
| 7+            | -3              |
If successful, you may continue as normal. If failed, roll 1D8 + Stress Points, and find the result on the below table. If you are already suffering from a Panic Effect and panic again, new result replaces old. If the new roll is lower than previous one, it is automatically adjusted to one step more severe than the previous one.

**Long Term Trauma**
Stress doesn’t inflict critical injuries like damage does, but if you have rolled **15+ on the Panic Table,** you risk suffering long-term mental trauma. Next time you rest or sleep for a Quarter Day, make an **unmodified WITS and EMPATHY roll** (attribute only, no skill). If you **a)** fail both rolls, or **b)** only fail the WITS roll, you develop a long-term mental trauma of some kind – roll 1D12 for Trauma Effect, +1 per Trauma Point you have accumulated. If you roll the result of a Trauma you already possess, you must select the next highest on the table. Every time you roll for a Trauma Effect, you earn +1 **Trauma Point**, which should be tracked on your character sheet. This represents the mentally debilitating effect of continued exposure to the stresses of a life of adventure.

When you gain a Trauma Effect, roll for Healing Time. The Trauma Effect will naturally wear off after that time passes if it's not treated through therapy.

### **Healing**

**Reducing Stress Points**
You can reduce your Stress points in 5 ways: 1) Resting, 2) finding stress relief in another's influence, 3) spending time with your Anchor, 4) having fun for a quarter day, or 5) spending a Willpower point. 
Note: Some Conditions can block your ability to relieve stress- Sleepy, Cold, Nightmares Trauma Effect, Substance Abuse Trauma Effect, Descent into Madness Trauma Effect. 

RESTING
Automatically heal 1D worth of Stress Points for each Quarter Day spent RESTING in a safe area that is secured from enemies as far as you know.

SOCIAL STRESS RELIEF
Another character can relieve you of Stress Points with a successful INFLUENCE roll. The specialty INFLUENCE (Counseling) + SCHOLAR (psychology) can be used if relieving 1 person's stress (Counseling + Psychology can also be used to heal mental trauma), and INFLUENCE (performance) can be if relieving 1 or more person's stress. The Influencer relieves 1 Stress Point per Success. The Influencer's roll may be pushed, but each BANE inflicts +1 Stress point on the Influencer. 
The INFLUENCE roll is modified as follows:

| Condition                                                                | INFLUENCE <br>modifier      |

MEETING YOUR ANCHOR
If you spend an hour or more with one of your Anchors, you relieve all stress. This can only be done once per session. Typically, this is played out as one short scene where you get to talk to your Anchor. You might, for example, spend the night together, work together in the field, go on a ride in the car to check something out, or play poker all night. It is not possible to relieve stress with an Anchor who dislikes you – you better keep those Anchors happy!

HAVING FUN
If you spend a quarter day doing some activity that your PC find fun and/or meaningful that involves no Stress gain (practicing a skill you enjoy, smoking and drinking, folding origami, sex drugs rock and roll, gardening, etc), roll INSIGHT (calm), and lose 1 Stress Point for every success. 
Note: This CAN be the same as RESTING if the fun activity involves siting idle, generally not doing much, and making no rolls beyond some non-strenuous or non-stressful Wits or Empathy rolls. Hard work like practicing most skills, or energetic carousing are not RESTING.

**Stopping Panic Effects**
There are three ways Panic Effects end: 1) The Panic Effect is Immediate only, or one Turn (15 min) passes, 2) You are Broken, 3) Another character may RALLY you.

RALLY
Another character within 10m may help you regain your senses by making an INFLUENCE (counseling)/ (command) roll. This is a slow action. If successful, your Panic Effect ends and you lose 1 Stress Point. The RALLY action only reduces Stress Points if it is used to end a Panic Effect.

**Healing Trauma Effects**
After the rolled Healing Time has passed, you may attempt to heal your own Trauma Effects by rolling INSIGHT (calm) once per week. A success rids you of the Trauma Effect. Seeking treatment at any time can significantly speed up Healing. Treatment involves any form of psychological therapy from another character for 1 Quarter Day and the therapist must roll INFLUENCE (counseling) and may add SCHOLAR (Psychology). The roll may be pushed, but each BANE gives the therapist +1 Trauma Point. For every day with 1 successful therapy session, reduce healing time by 1 week.

**Healing Trauma Points**
Every time you roll for a Trauma Effect, you earn +1 **Trauma Point**, which should be tracked on your character sheet. This represents the mentally debilitating effect of continued exposure to the stresses of a life of adventure. These can also be gained from directly trying to heal someone's trauma, which is transferable. 


Explosions 
The strength of an explosion is measured by its blast power, typically ranging from 2d12 to 2d6, where 2d12 is the most powerful explosion. The blast power has its full value in the 10m area where the detonation takes place,  and is reduced by one step towards 2d6 for every 10m away from the detonation point. If it is reduced below 2d6, it had no effect. 

When an explosive detonates, roll the two dice once for each person within range of the explosion. If one or X more is rolled, the target is hit by the blast. The damage done is increased by 1 for each additional X rolled beyond the first. Roll the hit location normally.

SUPPRESSION: Any person in the blast area of an explosion, even if they are not hit, is automatically knocked prone and must make an immediate INSIGHT: Calm roll or be suppressed. This does not apply to targets inside vehicles or behind cover that the blast cannot penetrate.

PRONE: If the target is already prone, the blast power is reduced one step.

COVER: Solid cover (page 58) provides protection against shielded hit locations, just like for a ranged attack – unless the explosion occurs in the same hex as the target.

| Blast Power | Base Damage |
| :---------: | :---------: |
|    2D12     |      4      |
|    2D10     |      3      |
|     2D8     |      2      |
|     2D6     |      1      |


**STRUCTURAL DAMAGE**
A building, bridge, wall, or other structure may suffer structural damage when subject to explosions or targeted by destructive weaponry. When this happens you and your group can resolve the damage narratively or by using the following rules. In the simplest way, there's nothing stopping a GM from ruling that structures collapse as a result of story-driving events or that there are "enough explosives" to destroy the targeted building regardless of die rolls. This section is included to provide a more defined method of calculating structural damage if desired.


Structures have a number of Hit Points (HP), an Armor Rating equal to the Protection value they provide characters using the structure as Cover, and may suffer critical damage when hit with 3 or more points of Damage. The following examples, while not exhaustive, provide the GM with some of the most common structural elements:


| Structure Type                      | HP (in 3m sq. sect.) | Armor Rating |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Light Wooden Fence / Bushes         | 1                    | Light 1      |
| Light Wooden Wall, Door, or Support | 3                    | Light 2      |
| Dense Hedgerows or Bushes           | 2                    | Light 3      |
| Aluminum Siding or Wall             | 4                    | Light 4      |
| Sandbag                             | 1                    | Heavy 1      |
| Rail Line                           | 3                    | Heavy 3      |
| Heavy Wooden Wall, Door, or Support | 5                    | Heavy 3      |
| Stucco and Cement Wall              | 6                    | Heavy 2      |
| Sandbag Wall                        | 2-5                  | Heavy 2-4    |
| Solid Tree Trunk                    | 6                    | Heavy 4      |
| Brick and Mortar Wall               | 8                    | Heavy 5      |
| Heavy Stone Wall or Structure       | 7                    | Heavy 6      |
| Concrete Wall                       | 8                    | Heavy 8      |
| Steel Structures / Bridge           | 8-10                 | Heavy 10     |
| Defensive Casemate                  | 8-10                 | Heavy 10-12  |


Note that while the HP column indicates values for each 3m sq. area, structural damage that destroys any portion of a building will often compromise the rest of the building as well, particularly if the rest of the structure stands above the damaged section! Also, a GM should adjudicate whether damage that does not fully destroy a structure instead damages it enough to blast a hole in a wall, for example. A GM should use some logic to determine if damage to one section of a structure may inflict collateral damage on other sections as well.
	As an example: a GI fires a bazooka at the wall of a brick and mortar building. He scores a hit and rolls the Damage die, determining the hit inflicts 5 points of damage. While this is less than the 8 HP listed above, the GM would be in the right to describe a gaping hole appearing in a large portion of the wall, after the smoke clears. Moreover, a roll on the Structural Critical Damage table (provided below) is in order as well!

In other situations, a GM may also declare a particular weapon has no chance to destroy a structure even if the HP total is reduced to 0.
	As an example: a GI fires his pistol at a Light Wooden Fence. While the player may indeed roll enough damage to 'destroy' the fence (or even cause a critical!), the GM may rule otherwise to maintain a sense of realism. The fence may be peppered with bullet holes, but the GM may rule that it remains standing.

While smaller structures may be destroyed outright, a larger structure (4 or more HP) that suffers 3 Damage in one hit, has been critically damaged. Roll a d6 and consult the table below:


**Structural Critical Damage Table**

| Roll D6 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | **Structural Damage:** A cloud of debris reveals the now weakened structure still intact. +1 to the next Damage roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2       | **Small Collapse:** A minor component of the structure collapses and breaks free. If there is a character on or near the structure, they may be adversely affected. Make an Opposed Nimble test versus a 4 dice Debris Attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3       | **Substantial Collapse:** Beams, struts, or other components collapse, threatening the stability of the structure. All characters near, within, or atop the structure must make an Opposed Nimble test versus a 6 dice Debris Attack. +2 Damage to future rolls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4       | **Large Collapse:** A large section of the structure has fallen or broken free. Depending on where this may be, characters may fall or be subject to an immediate 8 dice Debris Attack. This may be a good use of a FUBAR!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5       | **It’s Going to Come Down!:** The structure is collapsing! Roll again on each subsequent turn until the building suffers Complete Structural Failure! Treat any further 5s rolled for this structure as 6s instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6       | **Complete Structural Failure!**: The entire structure comes crashing down or is fully destroyed in a catastrophic collapse. Characters within or on the structure will suffer appropriate damage depending on the structure’s size and their position when the collapse occurred. As a guideline, a 10 dice Debris Attack is appropriate for an average brick and mortar building. Characters may also receive Falling Damage if this causes them to fall from an elevated position on the structure. |

If the GM feels it is appropriate, they may require occupants to take a Guts test to remain in or on a building hit by a weapon with an AP value. Failing this test requires the occupants to exit the building as soon as possible.


DEBRIS ATTACKS
A Debris Attack requires the GM to roll a number of attack dice equal to the severity of the amount of Debris involved in the circumstances (as directed by the result of the roll on the Structural Critical Damage Table). This is treated like an enemy attack with a +0 to the Damage roll. Extra successes can be expended to add bonuses to the Damage roll or to knock characters prone.



CONDITION: ADDICTED
You feel an urge to use the substance every day. 
- You use the substance each day if it is easily available, like in your inventory. 
- If the substance isn’t available. You take 1 Empathy damage and you cannot recover Empathy in anyway this day, except through magic.
- Roll insight after each day you fail to get the substance. On a failure, you take another Empathy damage. On a success, you may instead pay a Willpower Point to get rid of the addicted condition.
- If your Empathy breaks while addicted, and the resource isn’t available, you will go to lengths to get the substance. If your party has not been supportive that getting the substance is the number one top priority, you will abandon them. The GM has the final call to what happens.


CONDITION: FILTHY
You have 6 Hygiene points.
	-1 Every morning
	-1 more if yesterday was Hot
	-1 more if yesterday you hiked or performed physical labor for a quarter day, or experienced combat. 
If you reach 0, you gain the condition FILTHY. Certain actions will regain Hygiene points:
	**Wash your clothes:** +1 hygiene point. +1 for soap. On journeys, wet clothes need a Quarter Day to hang
	in the sun or by a fire in order to dry.
	**Take a bath:** +1 hygiene point. +1 for soap
	**Haircut/face trim:** +1 hygiene point.
	**Apply perfume**: +1 hygiene point. 
If you lose all your Hygiene Points, you become FILTHY. Otherwise, your GM could perhaps give you the filthy condition from certain events. Like falling into a pile of manure? Or sleeping in the gutter after a too heavy night out? Being filthy has several effects:
- You both smell and look awful. Take a -2 penalty to all manipulation rolls against targets that aren’t filthy.
- You cannot help others who aren't filthy.
- Whenever you are Strength broken, you must roll against disease with a virulence rating of 4.
- As soon as you can wash yourself and your clothes (or in other way can regain a Hygiene die, if you use the “Hygiene” module), you are no longer filthy, but any contracted diseases stay.
