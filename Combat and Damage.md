### **ROUNDS AND INITIATIVE**

When a conflict begins, the first step is to determine who has the initiative. Do this before anyone rolls dice for an action.

Roll 2d6, and read the results as a 2-digit number. Highest acts before lowest, and ties have a roll-off.

When all the participants in the combat have acted once, the round is over, and a new round begins. The round order remains the same throughout the whole conflict – drawing the initiative is only done once, at the start of the first round.

**ROUNDS & TURNS**  
In the game, a round can represent any period from 5 seconds up to a minute, depending on circumstances and the skills used. Another term used to keep track of time in the game is the turn. A turn is about 15 minutes long, and it is used primarily when exploring adventure sites

**SURPRISE**  
If you perform an attack that the GM deems surprising, you may roll initiative twice, and choose which one of the two rolls you want.

**TALENTS**  
Some talents also allow you to affect your initiative.

**CHANGING THE INITIATIVE**  
You never roll new initiative during a fight, but you can exchange your initiative – and thus your initiative for the round – with another player character. This can be done at the start of the fight or at the start of the round, but never during a round. You and the other player character must be able to speak to each other to exchange initiatives. You can exchange initiatives with an enemy through the FEINT action (see Close Combat).

### **SLOW ACTIONS AND FAST ACTIONS**

When it is your turn to act, without incurring an action penalty, you can perform one slow action and one fast action, or two fast actions. You may perform more actions than limited here (except for MOVE), but every FAST ACTION over the limit adds a -1 penalty and every SLOW ACTION over the limit adds a -2 penalty. Some Talents may increase this limit. This penalty is cumulative for the round and resets to 0 when your turn ends
A slow action usually consists of rolling for a skill. A fast action is quicker and doesn’t always require a dice roll, but can do so. See the lists of typical slow and fast actions on the next page. How these work is explained in detail in the sections Close Combat and Ranged Combat.

### **ZONES & RANGES**

The combat area is divided into zones. A zone is a room or an area of ground. How big a zone is varies – from a few steps across up to about 25 meters. A zone is generally smaller in difficult terrain than in open terrain. The distance from one zone to the next is called one segment.

**ZONE FEATURES**  
Zones can have various features, which affect actions performed in the zone.

CRAMPED: The zone is small and/or has a low ceiling. Attacks with HEAVY weapons get a –2 penalty, and it is impossible to SWING WEAPON before a close combat attack.

ROUGH: You must roll MOVE when you RUN into the zone. Failure means you managed to get into the zone, but you fall down.

OPEN: The zone is open and flat, which is ideal for mounted combatants. Read more below.

DARK/FOGGY: Ranged attacks into the zone are modified by –2 and can’t pass through the zone.

**RANGE CATEGORIES**  
In conflict, the distance between you and your opponent is divided into five range categories. See the table on this page. The Typical Terrain column lists the types of terrain where the maximum line-of-sight usually matches that category.

| Range                    | Shooting <br>Modification | Sneak Attack/Ambush<br> Modification |

### **AMBUSHES & SNEAK ATTACKS**
The key to winning a conflict is often attack- ing when your enemy least expects it. You can achieve this in several different ways.

SNEAK ATTACK: When you stalk someone and your attack catches them unawares, it’s called a sneak attack. First, roll an opposed roll for SNEAK. You get a modification depending on how close you are – see the table above in the Ranges section. If you want to attack in close combat, you usually have to get within ARM’S LENGTH . If you fail, your opponent spots you at your starting distance – draw initiative.  
If you succeed, you get a free action (slow or fast, but not both) before you draw the initiative. Your target cannot DODGE or PARRY a sneak attack, which gains a +1 to damage for every STEALTH success beyond what as necessary. Sneak attacks are always done individually, by one attacker against one target.

AMBUSH: A special kind of sneak attack is an ambush – you lie in wait for your enemy and attack when he passes. When you ambush someone, you roll SNEAK as described above, but with a modification of +2, since it is the target and not the attacker that is moving.  
Ambushes can be carried out by a group and against a group of targets. This follows the usual rules for SNEAK – for the attackers (whoever has the lowest SNEAK skill level roll) and for the targets (whoever has the highest SCOUT roll).

### **CLOSE COMBAT**

When you attack in close combat, you use the MELEE skill. Close combat usually happens at ARM’S LENGTH. With some weapons, you can attack from NEAR distance, such as Staffs, Spears, and Flails.

WEAPONS: When you enter close combat, it is wise to have a weapon in hand. Weapons give you a Gear Bonus for your roll (see page 49), increase the damage caused and allow you to perform actions that are harder or even impossible without a weapon. 

SHIELD: Carrying a shield is also very useful in close combat. You can PARRY attacks with it, but you can also use it to improve your ability to SHOVE opponents to the ground. 

SACRIFICING SHIELD: When using a PARRY action with a shield, the character can choose to discard the shield to reduce all damage from the parried attack to zero if it had at least one success on the PARRY roll. This leaves the shield completely broken.

STANCE: It is recommended that you stand on your feet when you attack. If you are prone, you must spend a Fast Action to GET UP. While prone, you may use the SHOVE attack. You may still attack with weapons that have NEAR range, however while prone it’s range is now ARM’S LENGTH and you suffer a -1 penalty. Standing enemies get a +2 modification on all melee attacks against a prone enemy.

ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY
Under 2 circumstances, an enemy may attack out of turn as a Reactive Action (counting against their action economy):
1) If they possess a melee weapon with SHORT range, and they are aware of an enemy **entering** the range of the melee weapon.
2) Not prone, and in possession of any melee weapon (not brawling), and they are aware of an enemy **leaving** the range of their weapon. 

### **RANGED COMBAT**

When you attack someone from a distance, you roll MARKSMANSHIP. You need a ranged weapon, even if it’s simply something to throw. 
#### AIMING 
As a fast action, before you SHOOT, you can AIM. This gives you a +1 bonus to the attack. If you do anything else except shoot your weapon after you have aimed, you lose the effect of the aim and you need to spend another fast action to aim again. You can fire repeatedly at the same target without breaking your aim.

You can’t AIM at an aware opponent at ARM’S LENGTH – he is too close for you to be able to draw a bead on.
Note the difference between AIMing and making a "Called Shot." Called shots suffer at least a -2 penalty, and strike chosen locations. You could, however AIM when making a called shot, making the called shot more likely to hit.

TELESCOPIC SIGHTS: If your weapon has a telescopic sight, you can aim as a slow action and get a +2 bonus. If you also have a stable platform to fire from (cover or a bipod, or the ground if you’re prone), the bonus is +3. No ammo dice can be used in the attack. Note, this means if you Slow Aim and fire in the same round, your bonus will be 0, or +1 if stable.

MOVING TARGET: If your target has moved since your previous turn, your shot gets a –1 modifier. If you fire from a vehicle that has moved since your previous turn, your shot gets a –2 modifier.

CALLED SHOTS / TARGET SIZE: You may choose to shoot at targets much larger or smaller than a human body. Refer to the table below. If hitting a body part with no armor, you bypass any armor rolls. If the body part is partially armored, the GM rolls for whether the armor was hit (e.g. headshot: did it hit the helmet or face?)

| Target Size                 | Modifier |
| --------------------------- | -------- |
| house                       | +3       |
| car / bus / 10m area        | +2       |
| horse                       | +1       |
| human body                  | 0        |
| full torso                  | -1       |
| head, limb, suitcase, rifle | -2       |
| face, smallarm              | -3       |
| eyeball                     | -4       |

ONE-HANDED SHOOTING: You can fire a firearm with the SMALLARM feature with one hand without penalty. Most submachine guns and carbines can be fired one-handed, but you get a –2 modifier to your roll (tagged "1H-2"). Rifles and assault rifles can be fired one-handed, but only at SHORT (10m) range and with a –3 modifier (tagged "1H-3"). Machine guns can never be fired one-handed (tagged 2H).
#### RANGE
| Range                    | Shooting <br>Modification |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Arm's Length<br>up to 2m | -2 (#)                    |
| Short<br>up to 10m       | -                         |
| Medium<br>up to 20m      | -1                        |
| Long<br>up to 100m       | -2                        |
| Distant<br>up to 300m    | -3                        |
| Extreme<br>up to 1km     | -4                        |
(#) Small-arms like pistols, sawed-off shotguns, SMGs, and light crossbows are modified by only -1 at Arm's Length

FIRING IN CLOSE COMBAT: If you shoot at an active and aware enemy within ARM'S LENGTH, you get a -2 modifier. Some small weapons have the feature "Small Arms" (pistols, sawed-off shotguns, SMGs, and light crossbows), which reduces the penalty to -1.

DEFENSELESS TARGET: If your target is within SHORT range (10m) and immobile or unaware of you, you gain a +3 bonus.

SHOTGUNS: For shotguns, range gives no negative modifier to hit. Instead, the base damage is reduced by 1 at MEDIUM range, by 2 at LONG range, and by 3 at EXTREME range. Note that the base damage at EXTREME range for most shotguns will be zero. Even a hit that inflicts no damage can cause suppression.

#### STANCE
Firing at a prone target gives you a –1 modifier unless the target is within SHORT range (10m), in which case being prone provides no protection. Remember, dropping to the ground is a free action but can only be done on your own turn. Standing up is a fast action.
#### COVER
You can, as a fast action, seek cover where appropriate terrain or barriers are within 10m. Remember, cover only works in a specified direction, i.e. not against attacks from the side or behind. You cannot be both prone and behind cover.

PARTIAL COVER: Partial cover does not modify the hit chance, but gives you an armor rating for body parts
behind the cover – torso and legs if you want to be able to fire a weapon, as you’ll need to expose your arms and head. Read more about hit locations and armor below. Cover has an Armor Rating and works like armor – but only against ranged attacks. As opposed to armor, cover is not degraded. Cover can be combined with armor – roll for cover first, then armor.

FULL COVER: Full cover breaks line of sight and typically makes it impossible to hit the target. Firing at a target in full cover can be done, with a –3 modifier, only if the GM rules that the attacker knows the approximate location of the target. All hit locations are protected by full cover as if wearing armor.

| Structure / Cover                  | HP   | Armor Rating | Piercing Protection |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Light Wooden Fence / Bushes        | 1    | 1            | Light               |

| Solid Tree Trunk                   | 6    | 15           | Heavy               |
| Brick and Mortar Wall              | 8    | 16           | Heavy               |
| Reinforced Stone Wall or Structure | 7    | 17           | Heavy               |
| Concrete Wall                      | 8    | 19           | Heavy               |
| Steel Structures / Bridge          | 8-10 | 21           | Heavy               |
| Defensive Casemate                 | 8-10 | 21-23        | Heavy               |

**Light Protection** represents weak or thin protection. Any weapon is theoretically capable of penetrating Light Protection. It counts as armor. However, Light Protection is especially vulnerable to Armor-Piercing weapons. When an AP weapon makes an attack against a target with Light Protection, the protection/armor rating is reduced by the Base Damage value of the AP weapon- before any armor is rolled. If this reduces the Protection pool to zero the Cover or Armor offers no Protection against that attack.

**Heavy Protection** represents the armor you would find on a tank or protection provided by a solid wall, or a concrete casemate. Heavy Protection is so tough that it cannot be penetrated by a weapon unless the weapon possesses the Armor-Piercing feature. Against Armor-Piercing weaponry, the target will roll its full Armor + Cover pool to defend against the attack.

DODGING GUNFIRE: If you are aware of an imminent firearms attack against you (you see someone lift their weapon to fire at you), you may perform a Reaction to dodge. Note that if their gunfire is what is alerting you to being targeted, it is too late to DODGE, but as a Reaction, you may still:
	a) Hit the dirt. Fast Action. No roll needed. You go prone, imposing a -1 penalty on anyone attacking further than Short Range (10m).
	b) Seek Cover. Fast Action. Roll MOVE. If the terrain allows it, immediately take full or partial cover behind a barrier. Under partial cover, the barrier is essentially armor. Under full cover, enemies can rarely even target you. 
	
If it is your turn, and you are reasonably sure that you're about to be fired upon in the next round, you have more options:
	a) Dodge pre-emptively. Your dodge roll will apply to the next ranged attack against you.
	b) Keep moving. An attacker suffers a -1 penalty if you've moved since their last round.
	c) Hit the dirt. As a free action, you may go prone, imposing a -1 penalty on anyone further than 10m.
	d) Seek cover. If the terrain allows it, immediately take full or partial cover behind a barrier. Under partial cover, the barrier is essentially armor. Under full cover, enemies can rarely even target you.
#### FRIENDLY FIRE
You can fire at a target even if your line of fire passes within 5m of one or more friendly fighters are located, but these friendlies must all immediately make INSIGHT: Calm rolls to avoid being SUPPRESSED. Also, if your
shot misses, roll two D6 base dice – any X means a random friendly is hit instead, and a second X will increase the damage by 1.
#### OVERWATCH
As a fast action, you can assume an overwatch position against a specified 10m area in line of sight (including your own). If you have a telescopic sight, you can use a slow action to assume overwatch, claiming the normal bonuses for this when firing.   

Between now and your next turn, you can fire your weapon once against a target in the target area. You can fire whenever you want in the round, breaking the initiative order. Your shot is resolved before all other actions, even if they are already declared. For example, if an enemy in your target area wants to fire a weapon on their turn, you can shoot first. The enemy is not allowed to change their action after your overwatch attack.  

Firing when in overwatch position counts as a normal ranged attack (a slow action). Therefore, you must save your slow action in the round to be able to make an overwatch attack. You can only make one overwatch attack per round.  

If you and an enemy have overwatch against each other’s hexes, and both choose to fire at the same time, an opposed MARKSMANSHIP roll determines which attack goes first. This roll does not count as an action for either shooter.

LOSING OVERWATCH: You keep your overwatch position until you break it, or any of the following occurs:
- You perform any action other than overwatch fire.
- You are attacked in close combat.
- You suffer damage.
- You are suppressed.
#### TERRAIN, WEATHER, DARKNESS
The terrain of the target hex can give you a –1 or even a –2 modifier, unless the target is within 10m as you. Heavy rain, fog, and strong winds can give you a negative modifier to ranged attacks. The modifier is typically –1 but can be higher at the GM’s discretion.  

At dusk or in a dimly lit room, you suffer a –1 modifier to your shot. At night or in a dark room with only a little light, you suffer a –2 modifier. You cannot hit a target in total darkness. Night vision goggles and thermal optics can negate the effects of darkness.

SMOKE: Dense smoke (page 60) breaks line of sight and typically makes it impossible to hit the target. However, if the GM deems it likely that you know what hex your enemy is in, you can still fire, but with a –3 modifier.

ELEVATION: When firing from a hex at a higher elevation than the target, you gain a +1 modifier.

**RANGED FIRE MODIFIERS**

| FACTOR                      | MODIFIER |

| Heavy rain or wind          | –1       |
| Dense smoke                 | –3       |
#### AMMUNITION
Firearms store ammunition in a magazine or an ammo belt. How many rounds of ammo your weapon can hold is indicated by its Mag rating. A weapon can only be loaded with ammo of the correct caliber, as indicated in the Ammo column in the firearm listings.

AMMO DICE: Firearms give you ammo dice to add to your skill roll when you want to fire rapidly. When you do this, **all of the firearm's Gear Dice are reduced to 0, and are replaced by as many ammo dice as you like**, from 1 up to the rate of fire (RoF) rating of your weapon or the number of rounds left in the magazine, whichever is lower.

If you use no ammo dice at all, use full Gear Dice, and only one (1) round of ammunition is used in the attack. This is typically only the case for sniper shots, but can also be useful if you are very low on ammo or your weapon is in a bad condition (low reliability rating).

Rolling a 6 on an ammo die is a success just like with a D6 base die, but **successes on ammo dice do not contribute to hitting your target**. Instead, successes on ammo dice have different, specific effects, outlined below.  
ON A HIT (ammo dice don't count toward this):  
- Each X on your ammo dice can be used to (choose one)... 
	- Increase damage (each X increases the damage by 1) 
	- Trigger an additional hit on the same target  
	- Trigger a hit on a secondary target within 5m of the first. You cannot choose a secondary target that would be harder to hit directly than the primary target. Each additional hit inflicts base damage on a random hit location, and the damage is increased by 1 for each further X you spend on it. You can never hit more targets than you have rounds of ammo in the magazine of your weapon.
	- Pin your enemy triggering Panic Roll (may only be used once).
	- You position yourself and may exchange initiative score with your enemy, taking effect next turn. You can't go back to your earlier initiative (may only be used once). 
	- Disarm the target (may only be used once)
	- Opponent falls prone or is pushed back 1 meter (may only be used once).
ON A MISS:  
>>Rolling 1 or more X on your ammo dice means the target can still be SUPPRESSED: If target fails an INSIGHT (Calm) roll, they gain +1 stress, lose next Slow Action, next action must be to Seek Cover or remain in cover, cannot move toward danger next round, and all their allies within 10m and line of sight must also roll INSIGHT: calm to avoid being SUPPRESSED.

PUSHING & RELIABILITY: If you push your roll, you must also re-roll all ammo dice not showing BANE or X. Ammo dice have a BANE symbol on the one (1) side, just like base dice. When pushing, each BANE on an ammo die will reduce the reliability rating of the weapon by 1. Any BANE rolled in the initial roll (before pushing) are also counted.   
This means rolling more ammo dice will risk damaging your firearm – but only when you push the roll. If your weapon breaks due to pushing, it does so after the current attack is resolved. Read more about damage to gear and repairs ==LATER==

WEAPON JAM: If you roll two or more BANES on your ammo dice after pushing, your weapon jams immediately after resolving the attack (any X rolled still apply), in addition to the reduced reliability. Until the jam is cleared, the weapon cannot be fired. Clearing a jam is a slow action and requires a TECHNICAL roll. Multiple attempts are allowed.

AMMO SPENT: After your roll, you sum up the D6 digits on all of your ammo dice. This sum is the total amount of ammunition you have spent on the attack. You always spend at least one round of ammo, even if no ammo dice were used. If the sum on your ammo dice is equal to or more than the number of rounds you have left in the magazine, your magazine is completely emptied.

TRACKING AMMO: You must always keep careful track of how much ammo you have in your magazine or belt,
and how many magazines or ammo belts you carry.
- Mark down ammo spent in the current magazine or belt, using tally marks or digits, on the character sheet. When you reload, erase and start over.
- Note how many full magazines and ammo belts you have in your inventory. A ==magazine weighs 1⁄4 of an encumbrance unit, while an ammo belt is one full unit==. When you reload, erase the spent magazine or belt from your inventory.

RELOADING: Once your magazine is depleted, you need to reload your weapon. Roll for TECHNICAL. If you succeed, reloading is a fast action. If you fail, it’s a slow action. You may attempt to reload even if you only have a fast action left in the round, but if you fail the roll, the action is forfeit. The roll itself is not an action.

FIELD OF FIRE:  Rapid fire directed at a 10m area, whether scoring a successful hit or not, may establish a corridor of dangerous flying lead called a Field of Fire. A **minimum of 15 rounds must be directed at a zone to create a Field of Fire**. This represents an ongoing hail of bullets extending from the successfully suppressing shooter to the targeted Zone, and lasts for the remainder of the same round. Any character within, or moving into or through this Field during the round must succeed in a **Move test at a penalty of -1 for ever 15 rounds being fired**. This Move test occurs before whatever intended action your character hopes to complete as they enter or are exposed to the Field of Fire (for instance, if you want to shoot out of a window that is exposed to a Field of Fire, you only get your shot off after succeeding on your Move test). Of course, if you are hit, you suffer the full consequences! 

If this Move test is failed, the character suffers a single Hit. The Damage roll on this hit is simply a d10 with a +1 modifier. This avoids having to randomly determine which suppressing weapon inflicted the hit in the event there were several covering the same Field of Fire. Additionally, these are random, less directly aimed hits anyway, so we might imagine them to be less precise. This will still trigger a Suppression roll.

If the rapid fire resulted in no hits, but did result in Successes on the Ammo dice, it may inflict a lucky hit on a chosen target. The chances of this depends on how many rounds were fired into the area:

| Rounds Fired | Roll per Ammo Success |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| 15+          | 1D                    |
| 30+          | 2D                    |
| 45+          | 3D                    |
| 60+          | 4D                    |
If a victim has already rolled their MOVE to avoid a Field of Fire in a round, and more Fields of Fire are imposed upon them later in that round, they may roll MOVE again, or keep their original roll result, imposing NEGATIVE DICE rolls upon their prior roll.

The Suppression's active Field of Fire can end prior to the round's conclusion if:
-  The shooter takes Damage or fails an INSIGHT: Calm test. 
- The shooter performs any other rolled action (reactive or otherwise) after having fired during the same Round.
#### BOWS AND THROWN WEAPONS 
Without a RoF, there are no ammo dice, simply add the weapon's Gear Dice to the attack roll. You can retrieve arrows or thrown weapons from the target (requires a slow action and a MEDICAL AID roll, failure inflicts 1 point of damage on the victim), or from the ground in the target hex if you missed (fast action), and use them again.  
Bows don’t need reloading, but before you fire a bow, you need to prepare the bow by nocking an arrow. This is a fast action. After you have prepared a bow, you can’t perform any action other than to aim (fast action) or shoot (slow action) – if you do, you’ll need to prepare the bow again. Crossbows are reloaded like firearms.  
Thrown weapons don’t need to be prepared before an attack.

### **EXPLOSIONS** 
The strength of an explosion is measured by its blast power, **which is always Armor Piercing**, typically ranging from 2d12 to 2d6, where 2d12 is the most powerful explosion. The blast power has its full value in the 10m area where the detonation takes place,  and is reduced by one step towards 2d6 for every 10m away from the detonation point. If it is reduced below 2d6, it had no effect. 

When an explosive detonates, roll the two dice once for each person within range of the explosion. If one or X more is rolled, the target is hit by the blast. The damage done is increased by 1 for each additional X rolled beyond the first. Note that explosions are always Armor Piercing, so Light cover and Armor ratings are reduced by the explosion's Base Damage. Roll the hit location normally.

SUPPRESSION: Any person in the blast area of an explosion, even if they are not hit, is automatically knocked prone and must make an immediate INSIGHT: Calm roll or be suppressed. This does not apply to targets inside vehicles or behind cover that the blast cannot penetrate.

PRONE: If the target is already prone, the blast power is reduced one step.

COVER: Solid cover provides protection against shielded hit locations, just like for a ranged attack – unless the explosion occurs in the same hex as the target.

| Blast Power | Base Damage |
| :---------: | :---------: |
|    2D12     |      4      |
|    2D10     |      3      |
|     2D8     |      2      |
|     2D6     |      1      |


**STRUCTURAL DAMAGE**
A building, bridge, wall, or other structure may suffer structural damage when subject to explosions or targeted by destructive weaponry. When this happens you and your group can resolve the damage **narratively** - there's nothing stopping a GM from ruling that structures collapse as a result of story-driving events or that there are "enough explosives" to destroy the targeted building regardless of die rolls. Or the GM may use the **Simulationist** rules, calculating structural damage:

Structures have a number of Hit Points (HP), an Armor Rating equal to the Protection value they provide characters using the structure as Cover, and may suffer critical damage when hit with 3 or more points of Damage. The following examples, while not exhaustive, provide the GM with some of the most common structural elements:

| Structure / Cover                  | HP   | Armor Rating | Piercing Protection |

Note that while the HP column indicates values for each 3m sq. area, structural damage that destroys any portion of a building will often compromise the rest of the building as well, particularly if the rest of the structure stands above the damaged section! Also, a GM should adjudicate whether damage that does not fully destroy a structure instead damages it enough to blast a hole in a wall, for example. A GM should use some logic to determine if damage to one section of a structure may inflict collateral damage on other sections as well.
	As an example: a GI fires a bazooka at the wall of a brick and mortar building. He scores a hit and rolls the Damage die, determining the hit inflicts 5 points of damage. While this is less than the 8 HP listed above, the GM would be in the right to describe a gaping hole appearing in a large portion of the wall, after the smoke clears. Moreover, a roll on the Structural Critical Damage table (provided below) is in order as well!

In other situations, a GM may also declare a particular weapon has no chance to destroy a structure even if the HP total is reduced to 0.
	As an example: a GI fires his pistol at a Light Wooden Fence. While the player may indeed roll enough damage to 'destroy' the fence (or even cause a critical!), the GM may rule otherwise to maintain a sense of realism. The fence may be peppered with bullet holes, but the GM may rule that it remains standing.

While smaller structures may be destroyed outright, a larger structure (4 or more HP) that suffers 3 Damage in one hit, has been critically damaged. Roll a d6 and consult the table below:

| Roll D6 | **Structural Critical Damage Table**<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | **Structural Damage:** A cloud of debris reveals the now weakened structure still intact. +1 to the next Damage roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2       | **Small Collapse:** A minor component of the structure collapses and breaks free. If there is a character on or near the structure, they may be adversely affected. Make an Opposed Nimble test versus a 4 dice Debris Attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3       | **Substantial Collapse:** Beams, struts, or other components collapse, threatening the stability of the structure. All characters near, within, or atop the structure must make an Opposed Nimble test versus a 6 dice Debris Attack. +2 Damage to future rolls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4       | **Large Collapse:** A large section of the structure has fallen or broken free. Depending on where this may be, characters may fall or be subject to an immediate 8 dice Debris Attack. This may be a good use of a FUBAR!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5       | **It’s Going to Come Down!:** The structure is collapsing! Roll again on each subsequent turn until the building suffers Complete Structural Failure! Treat any further 5s rolled for this structure as 6s instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6       | **Complete Structural Failure!**: The entire structure comes crashing down or is fully destroyed in a catastrophic collapse. Characters within or on the structure will suffer appropriate damage depending on the structure’s size and their position when the collapse occurred. As a guideline, a 10 dice Debris Attack is appropriate for an average brick and mortar building. Characters may also receive Falling Damage if this causes them to fall from an elevated position on the structure. |

If the GM feels it is appropriate, they may require occupants to take a INSIGHT: Calm test to remain in or on a building hit by a weapon with an AP value. Failing this test requires the occupants to exit the building as soon as possible.

DEBRIS ATTACKS
A Debris Attack requires the GM to roll a number of attack dice equal to the severity of the amount of Debris involved in the circumstances (as directed by the result of the roll on the Structural Critical Damage Table). This is treated like an enemy attack with a 1 Base Damage. Extra successes can be expended to add bonuses to the Damage roll or to knock characters prone.

#### EXPLOSIVE HEAVY WEAPONS
Hits from some heavy weapons (grenade launchers, rocket launchers, vehicle canons, grenades) generally have a dual effect: direct damage (dealt with normally) and explosive damage (described below).

EXPLOSION: The blast power of the explosive effect is indicated in the weapon lists [gear](gear.md). The effects of the explosion are in addition to the direct damage and rolled for separately, not affected by your attack roll.

HAND GRENADES: A few specialized rules: 
- You need to pull the pin before throwing the grenade. This is a fast action.
-  If a hand grenade lands within 10m, you've got 2 options: Drop prone (low risk), or return it (high risk). You must decide which option you're doing before rolling.
	- **Drop Prone:** roll MOVE (fast action) to drop prone before the detonation. You can even choose dive onto the grenade to save your friends – you will automatically be BROKEN and suffer a severe critical injury to your torso (roll two D10 on the crit list and apply the higher result), but no one else in the area suffers damage from the blast.
	- **Return the Grenade**: (as a fast action) roll MOVE -2 / XX to kick or slap the grenade in a random direction, causing it to DEVIATE (see below) 10m in a random direction. MOVE -3 / XXX to DEVIATE the grenade 10m in a chosen direction. MOVE -4 / XXX to pick up the grenade and roll Marksmanship (slow action) to throw it at a chosen target. 

TARGETING: Most heavy weapons are generally used against large targets such a vehicle or an entire hex on the
battle map. (Except for hand-thrown grenades,) you get no bonus for firing at large targets. Instead, you suffer a –2 penalty if you fire a heavy weapon at an individual. Factors such as range, target movement, elevation, light and weather give the same modifiers as for firearms (see above). Target terrain modifers also apply, except for attacks that target a 10m area instead of a specific target. Also, when targeting a 10m area, any extra on the attack roll have no effect.

RELOADING: Heavy weapons do not use ammo dice (except for rare exceptions). Generally, heavy weapons must be reloaded after each shot fired. This is a slow action, and no roll is allowed to reload faster. Reloading can be done by another person (a loader) or an autoloader (if the weapon is equipped with one), allowing the weapon to be fired every round.

DEVIATION: If an attack with an explosive effect fails – no matter if it was aimed at a 10m area or a specific target – roll two D6s to see where the round lands. The first D6 determines the direction of deviation (see the diagram to the right). The second D6 determines how far from the target area that the round lands, in 10m increments. The deviation cannot exceed half of the distance to the target (rounding up).

INDIRECT FIRE
Grenade launchers, thrown grenades, and mortars are capable of indirect fire – firing in an upward arc to hit targets not visible from the firing position. You may either aim for a general 10m area, or for a specific target. To hit a specific target with indirect fire, you need a FORWARD OBSERVER who does have line of sight to the target and is able to communicate with you.

Directing indirect fire requires a slow action and a OBSERVATION: Forward Observer roll. It needs to be done before the weapon is aimed (this can be a good opportunity to exchange initiatives). If the spotter’s roll fails, the indirect fire will automatically deviate. If the spotter succeeds, the gunner resolves the attack normally. Extra X on the spotter’s roll have no effect.

The spotter can call in corrections (each correction gives a +1 to the next attack against the same target, up to a maximum bonus of +3). This is a slow action and requires no dice roll. After corrections have been called in, the gunner needs to spend a slow action correcting their aim.

#### LANDMINES
Placing landmines in a 10m area manually requires 15 min of work and a TECHNICAL: Demolitions or CRAFTING: Demolitions (-1 DM) roll. Success turns the area into a minefield. If you fail the roll, the minefield is created but it will automatically be spotted by anyone moving into the hex. You can roll TECHNICAL: Demolitions or CRAFTING: Demolitions (-1 DM) again in the next 15-min to hide the mines better. Some types of mines can be scattered by artillery.  
Several mine models are listed in [Gear](Gear.md). They fall into three main categories: anti-personnel, anti-tank, and directional.  

**ANTI-PERSONEL MINES**  
These detonate when stepped upon. At least one mine is placed in each 10m area. Their primary purpose is to blow the victim’s foot or leg off, disabling the victim rather than killing them.  
Detecting a field of blast mines requires a successful OBSERVATION: Scout roll (passive). If the roll fails and you move unawares into a minefield, the GM rolls a D6 for every 10m area you traverse. If the roll is equal to or less than the number of mines in the hex, you trigger a mine.  
To move through a detected minefield without setting off a mine, you must walk very slowly (5 meters per move action instead of 10 meters, and no additional movement is possible). You also need to make another OBSERVATION: Scout roll (no action) for each 10m area you move into. If you fail, roll for detonation as per above. If several people move together in a line, only the leader needs to roll to detect mines – the others can follow in their footsteps.  
If you trigger a mine, you suffer direct damage to your legs equal to the unmodified damage rating of the mine. The mine also triggers an explosion in the 10m area, which can cause further damage to you and others.

**ANTI-TANK MINES**  
These are larger and more powerful than anti-personnel mines and require more pressure to be detonated, and thus cannot be triggered by a person, only vehicles. Only one is typically placed in each 10m area.  
Spotting anti-tank mines is easier than blast mines (+2 modifier) but this is canceled by a –2 modifier if the
OBSERVATION: Scout roll is made from a vehicle. Driving unawares into a mined area will automatically trigger the mine. Driving through a detected minefield without setting off the mine requires very slow driving (10m per round) and a successful DRIVING roll for each round.  
When an anti-tank mine is triggered, the vehicle suffers direct damage equal to the unmodified damage rating of
the mine. The mine also triggers an explosion in the 10m area.

**DIRECTIONAL MINES**  
These are placed individually, not in minefields, and they are detonated remotely, usually by a tripwire. Directional mines do not inflict any direct damage, only blast damage, and only in an arc in front of the device (typically about 60 degrees). However, the blast power is only decreased one step for every 30 meters from the point of detonation instead of every 10 meters – see the diagram below.

![[Pasted image 20250101230848.png]]

**CLEARING MINES** is dangerous work. Clearing a 10m area of mines requires at least 15 min of work and a TECHNICAL: Demotions or CRAFTING: Demolitions (-1 DM) roll. Failure will detonate a mine. You will need at least a knife or a stick. More advanced gear can give you positive modifiers.
#### IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
IEDs can be very effective weapons. Setting up and arming an IED requires explosives, spare parts, 15 min of work, and a successful TECHNICAL: Demolitions or CRAFTING: Demolitions (-1 DM) roll. You can set up the IED to be triggered by a tripwire or pressure plate, effectively turning the IED into a mine (this requires one general spare part) or by an electronic remote control or timer (requiring one electronic and one general spare part). A failed roll will detonate the device immedaitely, so be careful! The blast power of an IED depends on the amount and type of explosives used.

SHRAPNEL: Fitting your IED with shrapnel will increase the blast power by one step, up to 2D12, but requires an additional general spare part and gives you a –1 modifier to setting the charge.

SHAPED CHARGES: have direct damage increased by 1, but the blast power for other targets in the 10m area is reduced one step. Setting a shaped charge is difficult (–2) and requires one additional general spare part.
### **ACTIONS**
There are several actions to choose from in close combat, all of which are described below. Different actions are effective in different situations, depending on what your opponent is doing. Some actions require a weapon with a certain feature.

#### **REACTIVE ACTIONS**  
When you attack an aware opponent in close or ranged combat, they can DODGE or PARRY to avoid being hit. The defender must declare if they are going to DODGE or PARRY **before** you roll for your attack. DODGE and PARRY are called reactive actions, since they are performed immediately, and they break the normal initiative order in the round. However, they do count toward your two available actions in the round (one slow and one fast action). For every reactive action you perform, you get one less action when it is your turn before you suffer a penalty, and once you have used both your actions during the round, any DODGE or PARRY rolls incur a -1 penalty (talents can modify this, however). DODGING and PARRYING in close combat are technically not opposed rolls, and they can be pushed.

Remember, beyond your two available actions, a Fast Action suffers -1 penalty, and a Slow Action suffers a -2 penalty.

#### **SLOW ACTIONS**

FORWARD OBSERVER: Slow Action. OBSERVATION: Forward Observer. Communicating with a marksman while their directing indirect fire (parabolic ranged attacks on targets outside marksman's line of sight). It needs to be done before the weapon is aimed (this can be a good opportunity to exchange initiatives). If the spotter’s roll fails, the indirect fire will automatically deviate. If the spotter succeeds, the gunner resolves the attack normally. Extra X on the spotter’s roll have no effect. The spotter can call in corrections (each correction gives a +1 to the next attack against the same target, up to a maximum bonus of +3). This is a slow action and requires no dice roll. After corrections have been called in, the gunner needs to spend a slow action correcting their aim.

GRAPPLE: You grab hold of your opponent. Roll for MELEE, as no weapon can be used. Can be DODGED or PARRIED. If the attack succeeds, both you and your opponent fall to the ground. The opponent drops any weapon they were hold- ing, and cannot move. The only action they can perform is **BREAK FREE** – which is a slow action and requires them winning an opposed MELEE or MIGHT against you. While you are grappling, the only action you can perform is a **GRAPPLE ATTACK.** It works like PUNCH/KICK/BITE, but is a fast action and cannot be DODGED or PARRIED.

PUNCH/KICK/BITE: Does not require a weapon. Roll for MELEE. Can be DODGED or PARRIED, and any attempt to PARRY gets a +2 bonus. If you hit, your opponent takes 1 point of damage to his Strength. If you roll multiple x, the damage increases by one for each additional x. If the enemy suffers a critical injury, roll on the table for blunt force wounds (unless you have fangs – in that case, use the table for slash wounds).

SHOOT: Slow action. Roll for MARKSMANSHIP and the weapon’s Gear Bonus, or Ammo Dice as the case may be. Modified by lots of factors. See RANGED COMBAT section. Bladed ranged attacks be DODGED under certain circumstances, but to PARRY a ranged attack the target must have a shield, or be very good with a melee weapon.  If you hit, your target takes Weapon Damage on his Strength. For every additional x rolled, the damage increases by one. If the target suffers a critical injury, roll on the table for stab wounds if you used a firearm or projectile blade, and use the table for blunt force if you used a sling or a thrown rock.

SLASH: SLASH and STAB will do the same amount of damage if they hit. SLASHING requires a weapon with the EDGED or BLUNT features. DODGING a SLASH gets a +2 bonus. If the enemy takes a critical injury roll on the table for slash wounds (for EDGED weapons) or blunt trauma (for BLUNT weapons).

STAB: STAB and SLASH will do the same amount of damage if they hit. Requires a weapon with the POINTED feature. PARRYING a STAB with a weapon suffers -2 penalty, but using a shield gains a +2 bonus. If the enemy suffers a critical injury, roll on the table for stab wounds. Stabbing is good for enemies without shields.

TACKLE: Slow Action. Melee -3 / XXX. Tackle an opponent within 10m range to the ground. If the opponent’s Strength is higher than yours, he can make a MIGHT roll (not an action) to stay on his feet. You both drop what you’re holding, both on ground, they’re now considered GRAPPLED. No effect on creatures with STR 8+.

WARRIOR'S VOICE: Slow action. INFLUENCE: Performance. Through song, cries, biting remarks, and unearthly wails, your voice inspires your comrades and strikes rage and distraction into the minds of your enemies. You may either intentionally choose which effect you're doing, and achieve 1 success (incurring an appropriate Difficulty Modifier), or roll without penalty, and choose the effect based on how many successes you've rolled. Consult the table of effects below.

| Warrior's Voice Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | DM         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Taunt Enemies:** Roll an opposed roll for INFLUENCE versus INSIGHT. The enemy must be within 20m and be able to understand your language. You cannot taunt monsters or animals. If you succeed, choose one of the following effects:  <br>- The enemy is angered and must direct their next attack at you, if at all possible.   <br>- The enemy is distracted and his next roll is modified by –1. If you roll more x than you initially needed to win, the enemy’s next roll is modified by an additional –1 for every x. | -0 / X     |
| **Heartening Warcry:** Emit a **warcry that grants a bonus** all your comrades within 20m to all attacks during one round, until it’s your turn to act again in the next round. Their rolls are modified by +1, with another +1 for every extra success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | -3 / XXX   |
| **Distracting Warcry:** Roll an opposed roll for INFLUENCE -4 versus INSIGHT. Emit a **roar that causes a penalty** to close combat attacks from all opponents within 20m until it’s your turn to act again in the next round. Their rolls are modified by -1, with another -1 for every extra success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | -4 / XXXX  |
| **Transfer Willpower:** Your song **grants a portion of your Willpower** to one of your comrades within 100m. You simply give a number of WP of your choice to your friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | -5 / XXXX  |
| **Dishearten Foes:** Roll an opposed roll for INFLUENCE -6 versus INSIGHT. You can perform so powerfully that your song cuts into the hearts of any listeners within 20m. Your **song causes one point of damage Empathy**, +1 per extra success. You can distribute the damage across as many opponents as you want. No effect against monsters.                                                                                                                                                                             | -6 / XXXXX |

#### **FAST ACTIONS**
AIM: Fast action. Before you SHOOT, you can AIM. This gives you a +1 bonus to the attack. You must AIM and SHOOT in the same round – you cannot save the bonus for a later round. Please note that you cannot READY your weapon, AIM and SHOOT in the same round, as that is a total of three actions. It’s possible if you have the FAST SHOOTER talent, however.  
You can’t AIM at an aware opponent at ARM’S LENGTH – he is too close for you to be able to draw a bead on.
Note the difference between AIMing and making a "Called Shot." Called shots suffer at least a -2 penalty, and strike chosen locations. You could, however AIM when making a called shot, making the called shot more likely to hit.

CHARGE ATTACK: Move from 10m to Engaged (fast action) then performing a SLASH, STAB, PUNCH, or SHOVE (slow action). This combination is recognized in order to give the Charger specialization a die bonus.

COMMAND: INFLUENCE roll. Fast Action. These are a range of possible uses of the INFLUENCE skill to grant allies an extra edge in the heat of battle. You may either choose a specific effect (and take the appropriate difficulty modifier), or roll without penalty and achieve the appropriate number of successes. 

| COMMAND Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | DM        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **"Make a Plan."** You begin to organize a plan with any allies within 20m. All willing participants must collectively give up a Slow Action when their turn comes. In the following round, the characters who participated may take all of their available actions in any order on any initiative slot rolled by one of the characters in the participating group. | -1 / XX   |
| **You issue a order**. Any ally within 20m who acts in pursuit of that order can add a d8 to one roll. 1 extra Command success increases that bonus to D10. 2 extra Command successes increases that bonus to D12                                                                                                                                                   | -3 / XXX  |
| **Hustle!:** Allowing one **ally within 20m to take a free fast action.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | -3 / XXX  |
| **Rally**. When allies within 10m range are Broken from a FEAR attack, negate the horror critical, but they remain Broken. Every extra success can reduce an ally Broken from FEAR to 1 Wits instead of them being Broken.                                                                                                                                          | -4 / XXX  |
| **On the Double!**: Allowing an 20m range **ally to take a free slow action**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | -5 / XXXX |

DEFEND OTHER: MOVE or PARRY roll. Fast Action. Reactive Action. When attempting a Defend Other action, you may either choose an intended effect (inflicting a negative modifier), or roll without modifier, and attempt to roll the appropriate number of successes. 

| DEFEND OTHER Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | DM        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| **Protective Parry**. When a friend within 10m range is attacked, you may PARRY the attack for him. Your PARRY follows the normal rules and counts as one of your actions in the round. Any unparried damage continues to the intended target, not you.                              | -3 / XX   |
| **Bodily Replace**. Immediately switch places with an ally within 10m engaged in battle. The movement can’t be made through walls or in other ways that would break the laws of physics. Does not count as an action for your ally.                                                  | -4 / XXX  |
| **Body Block**. You may attempt this action at any time, throwing yourself in front of an ally within 10m distance who is being attacked, and suffer 1 damage instead of your friend. If successful, you may add Willpower points, taking on 1 more damage for every Willpower used. | -5 / XXXX |
DISARM: You try to knock the weapon from your opponent’s hands. Roll MELEE and your weapon’s Gear Bonus. Disarming an opponent wielding a one-handed weapon requires one X, a two-handed weapon requires XX. If you succeed, your opponent drops their weapon, which lands at ARM’S LENGTH. You cannot DISARM a shield. Your enemy can PARRY or DODGE your DISARM.

DODGE: You throw yourself out of the way of your opponent’s melee or ranged attack. Fast action, Reactive action. Roll MOVE. You cannot use a weapon. If the attacker SLASHES, you get a +2 bonus. Every X you roll eliminates a X from the attacker’s roll. There are 3 kinds of Dodge:
1) Standing Dodge. MOVE -2 vs 1 attack, remain standing. If you remain standing and you've negated all damage with a -3 penalty, OR roll XX beyond all damage negation, you may at the same time move 10m. Acrobatic flip!
2) Dropping Dodge. MOVE vs 1 attack, fall prone, imposing an additional -1 penalty on all attacks beyond 10m.
3) Flying Dodge. MOVE +2 vs all attacks, fall prone 3m away, take no actions (besides stand) next round if it’s a reaction.

DODGING GUNFIRE: If you are aware of an imminent firearms attack against you (you see someone lift their weapon to fire at you), you may perform a Reaction to DODGE their attack. Note that if their gunfire is what is alerting you to being targeted, it is too late to DODGE their first attack, but as a Reaction, you may still:
	a) Hit the dirt. Fast Action. You go prone, imposing a -1 penalty on anyone attacking further than Short Range (10m).
	b) Seek Cover. Fast Action. If the terrain allows it, immediately take full or partial cover behind a barrier. Under partial cover, the barrier is essentially armor. Under full cover, enemies can rarely even target you. 

If it is your turn, and you are reasonably sure that you're about to be fired upon in the next round, you have more options:
	a) Dodge pre-emptively. Your dodge roll will apply to the next ranged attack against you.
	b) Keep moving. An attacker suffers a -1 penalty if you've moved since their last round.
	c) Hit the dirt. As a free action, you may go prone, imposing a -1 penalty on anyone further than 10m.
	d) Seek cover. If the terrain allows it, immediately take full or partial cover behind a barrier. Under partial cover, the barrier is essentially armor. Under full cover, enemies can rarely even target you.

FAST KIP: Move -5. Allows you to get up from prone position without spending an action. If successful, you are standing, and may now perform a Kick as a Fast Action. Failure means you've used a Fast Action, and remain on the ground.

OVERWATCH: Fast action, you can assume an overwatch position against a specified 10m area in line of sight (including your own). If you have a telescopic sight, you can use a slow action to assume overwatch, claiming the normal bonuses for this when firing. Between now and your next turn, you can fire your weapon once against a target in the target area. You can fire whenever you want in the round, breaking the initiative order. Your shot is resolved before all other actions, even if they are already declared. For example, if an enemy in your target area wants to fire a weapon on their turn, you can shoot first. The enemy is not allowed to change their action after your overwatch attack. Firing when in overwatch position counts as a normal ranged attack (a slow action). Therefore, you must save your slow action in the round to be able to make an overwatch attack. You can only make one overwatch attack per round. If you and an enemy have overwatch against each other’s hexes, and both choose to fire at the same time, an opposed MARKSMANSHIP roll determines which attack goes first. This roll does not count as an action for either shooter.
LOSING OVERWATCH: You keep your overwatch position until you break it, or any of the following occurs:
- You perform any action other than overwatch fire.
- You are attacked in close combat.
- You suffer damage.
- You are suppressed.

PARRY: You block your opponent’s attack. Fast Reactive action. Requires a shield or a weapon. Roll MELEE and the Gear Bonus of the shield or weapon used. If you PARRY with a weapon that lacks the PARRYING feature, you get a –2 penalty. If the attacker STABS you, you get a +2 bonus when you PARRY with a shield but a –2 penalty if you parry with a weapon. Every X you roll eliminates a X from the attacker’s roll. Any excess X have no effect.  
- Parrying Ranged Attacks: you must either have a weapon with the PARRYING feature and take a -3 penalty, or use a shield. Roll using MELEE and the Gear Bonus. Every X you roll eliminates one X from the attacker’s roll. Any excess X have no effect. Only shields can parry firearm attacks. 
- Sacrificing Shield: When using a PARRY action with a shield, the character can choose to discard the shield to reduce all damage from the parried attack to zero if it had at least one success on the PARRY roll. This leaves the shield completely broken.

READ ENEMY: INSIGHT roll, Fast action. -3 / XXX. Foresee how one opponent will act in the coming round. All your attack and defense rolls against this opponent get a +1 modification until it is your turn again in the next round. Every success beyond what is needed grants an additional +1 modification. 

SEEK COVER: Fast action. Reactive. Roll MOVE. Requires terrain within 10m that can provide cover. 

SHOVE: You try to push your enemy to the ground. Roll MELEE. A weapon with the HOOK feature or a shield can be used (add the item’s Gear Bonus). If your opponent has higher Strength than you, two X are required to succeed, otherwise one is enough. If they roll MOVE at -5 / XXXX, any shove attempt fails. If the attack is successful, your opponent falls to the ground and is prone. Any additional X have no effect. Your opponent can DODGE to avoid your SHOVE. PARRYING a SHOVE requires a shield.

SWING WEAPON: A Fast action that must be performed directly before a SLASH or STAB, in the same round. You swing your HEAVY melee weapon to make your upcoming strike more powerful. No roll is required, and grants your next successful strike +1 damage
You may optionally perform a "Mighty Swing" by roll MIGHT during this action. The result of successes can be varied. Refer to the table below for effects, which may be intended (1 success, including the appropriate modifier), or lucky (no modifiers, but you've rolled the appropriate number of successes). Note that if you roll MIGHT with no modifiers, 1 success has no effect.

| MIGHTY SWING Effects (MIGHT roll)                                                                                                                                                                                    | DM         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Extra Damage:** Replace the +1 damage bonus with the rolled result. Gain a +2 bonus to the Might roll if you use both hands.                                                                                       | -2 / XX    |
| **Disrupt Parry:** Opponents suffer a penalty to parry your swing weapon attacks equal to the number of hands you are holding it with.                                                                               | -3 / XXX   |
| **Attack Weapon:** Any item that parries your swing or slash attacks takes 1 damage per three negated successes. Reduce the required amount by 1 if using both hands or if the parrying weapon is weaker than metal. | -4 / XXX   |
| **Armor Pierce:** Any non-natural armor takes 1 extra automatic damage from your swing weapon attack.                                                                                                                | -5 / XXXX  |
| **Wirlwind:** If you down an enemy with a swing weapon attack, you may perform a free run action and repeat the attack as a free action.                                                                             | -7 / XXXXX |

### **DAMAGE**
Damage can come in many forms and reduces one of your four attribute scores:

DAMAGE TO STRENGTH: Bleeding wounds, broken bones, and pain. This is the default type of damage. If the type of damage is not specified, it’s always damage to Strength.

DAMAGE TO AGILITY: Physical fatigue and exhaustion.

(==DAMAGE TO WITS: Fear, panic, and confusion. Read more under Fear Attacks on page 112.
DAMAGE TO EMPATHY: Despair, mistrust, sorrow.==)

#### SUFFERING DAMAGE  
You can suffer damage in many ways. These are the three most common:

BY ROLLING BANE/SKULL when you push a roll. When pushing, you suffer one point of damage to the attribute used for every BANE/SKULL you roll. Armor and cover have no effect against such damage.

FROM ATTACKS. Whenever someone successfully attacks you in close combat or with a ranged weapon, you suffer damage to Strength equal to the Weapon Damage plus one for every additional x your opponent rolls.

**PAIN**  
When you take 1 point of any kind of damage, your next action (in your turn, or a reaction) suffers a -2 penalty.

**HIT LOCATION**
When a human target is hit by a ranged attack, in close combat or by an explosion – roll a D6 to determine the hit location. If you fired a called shot or struck an aimed blow, you can choose the hit location freely. Never roll hit location for damage from pushing. 

| D6 roll | Hit Location |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 1       | Leg          |
| 2-4     | Torso        |
| 5       | Arm          |
| 6       | Head         |
**ARMOR**  
By wearing armor you can protect your body from damage to Strength. See [Gear](Gear.md) for various kinds of armor. Armor doesn’t provide protection from other kinds of damage, or from damage you inflict on yourself when you push a roll.

The effect of armor is determined by its Armor Rating. When you suffer damage from a physical attack, and the resulting hit location has armor on it, you **roll a number of Gear Dice equal to the Armor Rating**. Every X you roll decreases the damage by one. This roll does not count as an action and cannot be pushed.  

ARMOR ABLATION 
If any damage penetrates your armor, its Armor Rating can decrease – every SKULL/BANE you roll after penetration reduces the Armor Rating by one. If the armor absorbed all the damage, any SKULLS rolled has no effect. Armor can be repaired with a TECHNICAL or CRAFTING roll and a QD of work – each X rolled restores one point of armor, up to the original score. Natural armor is not degraded in this way.

SACRIFICING HELMETS: If you suffer a critical injury to the head, you may choose to roll a number of Gear Dice equal to the Armor Rating of the helmet. If you roll one or more X, the critical injury is changed to the 11–12 blunt force injury instead. This will reduce the Armor Rating of the helmet to zero however.

REMOVING HELMET BONUS: Once per day, when you take off your helmet during combat (a fast action), your next attack gains a +d8 artifact die.

### **STRESS**
Stressful experiences, such as getting shot at or witnessing harrowing scenes, can temporarily put you out of action or even cause long term psychological damage. A summary of the stress rules is this:
1) Certain mild-moderately stressful events cause you to gain Stress Points
2) Certain very shocking events cause you to roll Insight (Calm) to avoid Panicking. It's more difficult the more Stress Points you have.
3) Panicking means you roll on a Panic Effect table, and add the number of Stress Points. Worse effects occur the more Stress Points you have.

**Gaining Stress**
You can gain +1 (or more) stress points in several different ways:
- Suffering damage to any attribute. Each point of damage (including after BANES on pushed rolls) accrues +1 stress.
- Getting ==Suppressed== (see below)
- Firing a firearm on full-auto mode (not sure about this)
- Gaining the conditions Hungry, Tired, Thirsty, or Cold 
- Perform a Coup de Grace
- An ally attacks you
- Encountering frightening creatures or situations
- Seeing a friend suffer a lethal critical injury (+2)
- witnessing a massacre (+3) 
- being tortured (+3)

**Getting Suppressed**: Another way of gaining stress is getting hit by or receiving very close misses by firearm attacks, or being in the blast zone of an explosion. Suppression triggers your automatic instinct to seek cover.
If you are:
- Hit by a firearm
- Targeted (and missed) by firearm but the enemy Ammo Dice rolls an X 
- In the blast radius of an explosion
- 10m and line of sight from a Suppressed ally
- Inside a vehicle that is ==penetrated by an attack==

Then you must succeed on an INSIGHT: Calm roll (not an action) to avoid being SUPPRESSED:
- +1 stress
- Immediately ==Seek Cover== (fast action) and/or remain in cover during this round. 
- Lose next Slow Action.
- Next round, move away from perceived danger or stay put, but not towards it. 
- All allies within 10m and line of sight must roll to avoid becoming suppressed.

**Psychological/Fear attacks**: When a character succeeds in an INFLUENCE attempt, every success beyond the first one may (if they choose) add +1 Stress Point to the target. Beyond the second success, a success may (if they choose) trigger a Panic Check in the target.
*Example*: You roll 4 successes vs your target's 0 success. You now have 3 successes beyond the first. You may inflict up to +3 Stress Points, or up +2 Stress Points and a Panic Check.

**Panicking**
Eventually, stressful events will bring you to your breaking point. When that happens, there’s a chance that you’ll lose control and Panic. You determine this by making a **Panic Check**. There are many conditions that trigger a Panic Check:
- Your WITS or EMPATHY is reduced to zero.
- Witness an ally suffering from a certain panic effect (scream, flee, berserk)
- Witness your ==Anchor== suffer any Panic Effect
- You are Suppressed for the 3rd turn in a row.
- You suffer a Critical Injury
- Your ==Anchor== suffers a critical injury
- You're attacked by a strange creature you've never seen before
- A truly horrifying event occurs 
- Witnessing more than 1 ally Panic at the same time
- Seeing a friend die
- When death seems certain

**Panic Check**: roll INSIGHT: Calm, with a penalty depending on how many stress points you have;

| Stress Points | INSIGHT penalty |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 0-2           | 0               |
| 3-4           | -1              |
| 5-6           | -2              |
| 7+            | -3              |
If successful, you may continue as normal. If failed, roll 1D8 + Stress Points, and find the result on the below table. If you are already suffering from a Panic Effect and panic again, new result replaces old. If the new roll is lower than previous one, it is automatically adjusted to one step more severe than the previous one.

**Long Term Trauma**
Stress doesn’t inflict critical injuries like damage does, but if you have rolled **15+ on the Panic Table,** you risk suffering long-term mental trauma. Next time you rest or sleep for a Quarter Day, make an **unmodified WITS and EMPATHY roll** (attribute only, no skill). If you **a)** fail both rolls, or **b)** only fail the WITS roll, you develop a long-term mental trauma of some kind – roll 1D12 for Trauma Effect, +1 per Trauma Point you have accumulated. If you roll the result of a Trauma you already possess, you must select the next highest on the table. Every time you roll for a Trauma Effect, you earn +1 **Trauma Point**, which should be tracked on your character sheet. This represents the mentally debilitating effect of continued exposure to the stresses of a life of adventure.

When you gain a Trauma Effect, roll for Healing Time. The Trauma Effect will naturally wear off after that time passes if it's not treated through therapy.

#### **Healing Stress**

**Reducing Stress Points**
You can reduce your Stress points in 5 ways: 
1) Resting (1 QD, -1D stress)  
2) Finding stress relief in another's influence (1 rnd - 15 min, -1 stress per X)  
3) Spending time with your Anchor (1 hour, -all stress)
4) Having fun for a quarter day (1 QD, -1 stress per X)
5) Spending a Willpower point (instant, -1 stress per WP)
6) Interacting with Signature Item (Slow Action, -1D stress)
Note: Some Conditions can block your ability to relieve stress- Sleepy, Cold, Nightmares Trauma Effect, Substance Abuse Trauma Effect, Descent into Madness Trauma Effect. 

RESTING
Automatically heal 1D worth of Stress Points for each Quarter Day spent RESTING in a safe area that is secured from enemies as far as you know.

SOCIAL STRESS RELIEF
Another character can relieve you of Stress Points with a successful INFLUENCE roll. The specialty INFLUENCE: Counselor + SCHOLAR: Psychology can be used if relieving 1 person's stress (Counseling + Psychology can also be used to heal mental trauma), and INFLUENCE (performance) can be if relieving 1 or more person's stress. The Influencer relieves 1 Stress Point per Success. The Influencer's roll may be pushed, but each BANE inflicts +1 Stress point on the Influencer. 
The INFLUENCE roll is modified as follows:

| Condition                                                                | INFLUENCE <br>modifier      |

MEETING YOUR ANCHOR
If you spend an hour or more with one of your Anchors, you relieve all stress. This can only be done once per session. Typically, this is played out as one short scene where you get to talk to your Anchor. You might, for example, spend the night together, work together in the field, go on a ride in the car to check something out, or play poker all night. It is not possible to relieve stress with an Anchor who dislikes you – you better keep those Anchors happy!

HAVING FUN
If you spend a quarter day doing some activity that your PC find fun and/or meaningful that involves no Stress gain (practicing a skill you enjoy, smoking and drinking, folding origami, sex drugs rock and roll, gardening, etc), roll INSIGHT: Calm, and lose 1 Stress Point for every success. 
Note: This CAN be the same as RESTING if the fun activity involves siting idle, generally not doing much, and making no rolls beyond some non-strenuous or non-stressful Wits or Empathy rolls. Hard work like practicing most skills, or energetic carousing are not RESTING.

SPENDING WILLPOWER
Spending 1 Willpower immediately relieves 1 Stress Point. If this is done in anticipation of a GM calling for a Panic Roll, the point must be spent before the GM calls for the roll. 

INTERACTING WITH YOUR SIGNATURE ITEM
Some characters may have the Trait "Signature Item." Those that do may, once per session, interact with their signature item in some way to reduce your Stress Level by 1D6. This requires a slow action.

**Stopping Panic Effects**
There are three ways Panic Effects end: 1) The Panic Effect is Immediate only, or one Turn (15 min) passes, 2) You are Broken, 3) Another character may RALLY you.

RALLY
Another character within 10m may help you regain your senses by making an INFLUENCE: Counselor/ Command roll. This is a slow action. If successful, your Panic Effect ends and you lose 1 Stress Point. The RALLY action only reduces Stress Points if it is used to end a Panic Effect.

**Healing Trauma Effects**
After the rolled Healing Time has passed, you may attempt to heal your own Trauma Effects by rolling INSIGHT: Calm once per week. A success rids you of the Trauma Effect. Seeking treatment at any time can significantly speed up Healing. Treatment involves any form of psychological therapy from another character for 1 Quarter Day and the therapist must roll INFLUENCE: Counselor and may add SCHOLAR: Psychology. The roll may be pushed, but each BANE gives the therapist +1 Trauma Point. For every day with 1 successful therapy session, reduce healing time by 1 week.

**Healing Trauma Points**
Every time you roll for a Trauma Effect, you earn +1 **Trauma Point**, which should be tracked on your character sheet. This represents the mentally debilitating effect of continued exposure to the stresses of a life of adventure. These can also be gained from directly trying to heal someone's trauma, which is transferable. 





CONDITION: ADDICTED
You feel an urge to use the substance every day. 
- You use the substance each day if it is easily available, like in your inventory. 
- If the substance isn’t available. You take 1 Empathy damage and you cannot recover Empathy in anyway this day, except through magic.
- Roll insight after each day you fail to get the substance. On a failure, you take another Empathy damage. On a success, you may instead pay a Willpower Point to get rid of the addicted condition.
- If your Empathy breaks while addicted, and the resource isn’t available, you will go to lengths to get the substance. If your party has not been supportive that getting the substance is the number one top priority, you will abandon them. The GM has the final call to what happens.


CONDITION: FILTHY
You have 6 Hygiene points.
	-1 Every morning
	-1 more if yesterday was Hot
	-1 more if yesterday you hiked or performed physical labor for a quarter day, or experienced combat. 
If you reach 0, you gain the condition FILTHY. Certain actions will regain Hygiene points:
	**Wash your clothes:** +1 hygiene point. +1 for soap. On journeys, wet clothes need a Quarter Day to hang
	in the sun or by a fire in order to dry.
	**Take a bath:** +1 hygiene point. +1 for soap
	**Haircut/face trim:** +1 hygiene point.
	**Apply perfume**: +1 hygiene point. 
If you lose all your Hygiene Points, you become FILTHY. Otherwise, your GM could perhaps give you the filthy condition from certain events. Like falling into a pile of manure? Or sleeping in the gutter after a too heavy night out? Being filthy has several effects:
- You both smell and look awful. Take a -2 penalty to all manipulation rolls against targets that aren’t filthy.
- You cannot help others who aren't filthy.
- Whenever you are Strength broken, you must roll against disease with a virulence rating of 4.
- As soon as you can wash yourself and your clothes (or in other way can regain a Hygiene die, if you use the “Hygiene” module), you are no longer filthy, but any contracted diseases stay.
