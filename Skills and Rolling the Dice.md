[Talents](#talents)  

There are 17 skills in this game, and each has many specialties. They are all described later in this chapter. Every skill is connected to one of the four attributes: Strength, Agility, Wits, and Empathy. When you perform an action, you first describe what your player character does or says. Then you grab a number of six-sided dice equal to your skill level plus your current score in the attribute that is connected to that skill. If you have some sort of gear that may be helpful, you will get extra dice from that as well. Then you roll all the dice at once.

**SIXES MEAN SUCCESS**  
To succeed with your action, you must roll at least one six. A six is called a success, and these are marked in the rules with a symbol of two crossed swords: X. If you roll more than one X you can achieve additional effects in some cases – this is specified by each skill.

**ONES WEAR YOU DOWN**  
Ones can be bad for you – they can mean that you suffer damage, exhaustion, fear, or that your weapon has been damaged. Ones have no effect on your first roll, only if you choose to push your roll (see below). A one is called a BANE, and is marked with a skull symbol.

**DIFFERENT COLORS**  
Whether a certain die you have rolled originates from your attribute, your skill, or your gear, may be important. For that reason, you should use dice of three different colors. The dice from attributes are called Base Dice, the dice from skills are called Skill Dice, the dice from gear are called Gear Dice, and the dice from firearms ammo are called Ammo Dice.

**ROLLS WITHOUT SKILL**  
If you don’t have the skill required for the particular action you want to perform, you can roll anyway – simply roll your Base Dice and any applicable Gear Dice.

**THE ART OF FAILURE**  
If you roll no X something goes wrong. For some reason, you failed to achieve your goal. Feel free to elaborate on why with the help of the GM. She might even let a failed roll have further consequences to move the story for- ward in a dramatic way.  
Failure must not stop the story completely. Even when you fail, there must be a way forward – perhaps at the cost of time, risk, or silver, but still a way. The GM has the final say on the consequences of failure in that particular situation.  
You have one last chance if you really want to succeed – you can push the roll.

**CHANCES OF SUCCESS**
When you roll a lot of dice, it can be hard to predict the chance of success. The table below shows the chance of success when rolling with 1–10 dice. The third column shows the chance of success if you push the roll.

| Number of Dice | Chance of Success | Pushed Roll |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1              | 17%               | 29%         |
| 2              | 31%               | 50%         |
| 3              | 42%               | 64%         |
| 4              | 52%               | 74%         |
| 5              | 60%               | 81%         |
| 6              | 67%               | 87%         |
| 7              | 72%               | 90%         |
| 8              | 77%               | 93%         |
| 9              | 81%               | 95%         |
| 10             | 84%               | 96%         |

### **PUSHING YOUR ROLL**

If you are desperate to succeed with a skill roll, you can choose to push it. This means that you grab all the dice that did not come up as a six (x) or a one (SKULL) and roll them again. You get a new chance to roll x.  
You cannot choose which dice to reroll. When you push, you must roll all dice that did not come up as x or SKULL.

You are allowed to push rolls even after a successful roll, but only if rolling additional x will increase the effect of the roll in some way. The GM has final say on this. Pushing a roll is not without risk – more on that below. How a pushed roll plays out in story terms depends on what kind of action you are per- forming. It doesn’t have to be a physical effort, it might be about complete mental focus or an emotional struggle.

SKILL DICE: When you push a roll, ones from the Skill Dice do not count as BANE and can be re- rolled even if they do come up as a one.

GEAR DICE: If you push your roll, you must also push any Gear Dice. If the gear is a modern tool such as a firearm or vehicle using **Reliability Rating** instead of Gear Dice, any damage from pushing will decrease its reliability rating by 1 per BANE.

AMMO DICE: If you push your roll, you must also re-roll any ammo dice that aren't a SUCCESS or BANE. BANE  on ammo dice will damage your firearm and decrease its reliability rating, just like rolled on your base dice.

ONLY ONCE: You can only push your roll once. If you don’t succeed on your second try, you just have to deal with the consequences.

**SKULL IS ACTIVATED**  
When you push yourself hard, there is a risk that you will suffer damage or exhaustion, or that your weapon will be destroyed. After you have pushed your roll, look at all the dice on the table. In the first roll, SKULL had no effect, but when you push they become active. It doesn’t matter if the SKULL came up in the first roll or the second.  

- For every SKULL you have rolled on a **Base Die** when you push, you suffer one point of damage to the attribute you have used (read more about damage in COMBAT AND DAMAGE).  
- When you suffer damage to an attribute, you gain +1 Stress Point (see COMBAT AND DAMAGE).
- For every SKULL you have rolled on a **Gear Die** when you push, your weapon’s bonus is decreased by one (read more about that below).

Remember that ones on the Skill Dice never count as SKULL (see above).

**WILLPOWER**  
To push yourself to the brink of your abilities is risky, but it can also have positive effects – it gives you the force of will required to do special feats (described below).
For every SKULL you roll on the Base Dice (Weapon Dice do not count) when you push, you get a Willpower Point (WP) in addition to any damage you suffer. 

You can gain additional Willpower Points in two ways:

1) When you arrive home to your **Stronghold/Base** after a week or more away, and spend at least one day there. You will then gain 1 Willpower per week spent there for 3 weeks. This increases with a Shrine and a Theater.

2) If you have less than 2 Willpower points, you gain 1 Willpower every 4 days until you reach 2 WP. At that point, you stop automatically gaining WP. If you have 2 or more WP, you do not automatically gain any WP as time passes.

Mark your WP on your character sheet. You can never have more than ten (10) WP at any one time.

### **USING WILLPOWER**
There are several potential uses for Willpower:
- Convert 1 WP to 2 XP for the purpose of training skills.
- Ignore Suppression (see [Combat and Damage](Combat%20and%20Damage.md)).
- +1D to a roll per WP spent (max 4 WP per round). These can be granted to a fellow character if you are helping. 
- Re-rolling a critical damage result (once per injury), must use the new result.
- Remove 1 Stress Point. Must be done before GM calls for Panic roll.
- Buying success: If you are rolling 6+ dice (including Gear Dice), you may spend Willpower to buy 1 success. The cost is 3 WP. You may only buy the success before you’ve rolled the skill, and you may not subsequently roll the skill.


### **ONLY ONE CHANCE**  
As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed with any action. Once you have rolled the dice – and pushed the roll – you may not roll again to achieve the same goal. You need to try some- thing different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way. Or let an- other player character try.  
This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy over and over until he is sprawled bloody on the ground.

### **GROUP ROLLS**

When you face a challenge with your fellow adventurers, you don’t roll dice separately. Instead, one member of the group makes a single roll. Rolls where the weakest link could ruin it for everyone (like in STEALTH rolls) requires that the lowest skilled person makes the roll. Rolls where the success of experts outweighs the effects of failures (such as LORE or SCOUTING), the most skilled person rolls. The others may help them (see below) if it’s relevant to the situation. If the roll fails, it counts as a failure for all of you – you are not allowed to try one time each. This rule does not apply in combat, where each adventurer is free to attack any enemy they like.

### **MODIFICATION**

Sometimes, external factors help you to succeed. This gives you extra Skill Dice to roll. Other times, something hampers your action. This gives you fewer Skill Dice to roll than normal. This is called modification.  
Modification +1 means you roll one extra Skill Die, +2 means you roll two extra Skill Dice, and so on. Modification –1 means you roll one Skill Die fewer than normal, –2 means two fewer, and so on.  
Modifications only ever affect Skill Dice – never Base Dice or Gear Dice.  
Several modifications can apply to the same roll – add them together. A modification of +2 and one of –1 add up to +1.

NEGATIVE DICE: If, after modifications, you end up with exactly zero Skill Dice, you just roll your Base Dice (and any applicable Gear Dice). If you go below zero, you must roll this negative number of Skill Dice. These dice are called negative dice. Any x on negative dice eliminate an equal number of x on Base or Gear Dice. If you push your roll you must re- roll negative Skill Dice too (except the ones showing x of course).  
You can get modifications in several different ways: through talents, through the dif-ficulty of the action itself, and through help from others.

### **DIFFICULTY**

The GM will only call for a die roll if the difficulty level is average or greater, and success or failure would lead to interesting game outcomes. The GM might want to underscore that external factors either help or hinder an action. Use the following table for guidance:

DIFFICULTY MODIFICATION  
Trivial +3  
Simple +2  
Easy +1  
Average 0  
Moderate -1    
Challenging -2
Difficult -3
Very Difficult -5
Heroic -7

There are also cases when modifications are imposed by the rules, like when you aim carefully with a ranged weapon, shoot at long distance, or if you’re in a bad bargaining position when you attempt to MANIPULATE someone.

Under each skill, more difficult uses of the skill are described. Each section lists a DM "Difficulty Modifier" in the form of a die penalty and a number of successes, e.g. "-3 / XXX". This indicates that there are two routes of achieving the difficult effect: 1) intentionally attempting that difficult effect will result in a die penalty to your roll. 2) rolling your full die pool and "accidentally" achieving a difficult feat by achieving multiple successes. 
>Note that the probability of achieving a difficult feat is higher if you intentionally aim for it (choosing the die penalty). With 7 dice, achieving 1 success at -3 is 52%. With 7 dice, achieving XXX is 10%.

**HELP FROM OTHERS**  
Other PCs or NPCs can help you succeed at a skill roll. This must be declared right away, before you roll your dice. It must also make sense in the story – the individual helping you must be physically present and have the capacity to support your action. The GM has the final say. For each person helping you, you get a +1 modification. No more than three people can help you with a single roll, meaning your maximum modification from assistance is +3. In combat, helping counts as the same type of action as the one you are supporting (fast or slow). NPCs can help each other in the same way as player characters. Letting NPCs act in groups instead of individually is often an easy way to manage large numbers of NPCs in conflicts.

**OPPOSED ROLLS**  
Sometimes rolling an X isn’t enough to succeed with your skill roll. In some cases, you have to beat your foe in an opposed roll. To win an opposed roll, you have to roll successfully and roll more x than your adversary. Every x your adversary rolls eliminates one of your x. This means ties always go to the defender, since their X eliminates your attacking X. 
Sometimes you and your adversary roll for different skills, sometimes the same. Opposed rolls are common when you MANIPULATE or use STEALTH, and when someone uses those skills against you. The GM can also use opposed rolls when she deems it appropriate.  
DODGING and PARRYING in close combat are technically not opposed rolls, as they require an action by the defender and can be pushed.

### **NPCS AND SKILLS**  
Non-player characters use skills in the same way as player characters. The GM rolls dice for them, and they can push their rolls just like PCs can. But the GM only has to roll for actions that affect a PC directly – for example, if the NPC is attacking a player character or is attempting to save them. When an NPC performs an action that does not directly affect a PC, the GM can simply decide what happens.

### **GEAR DICE AND WEAR**  
To increase your chance of success, you can use gear. Gear can take the form of a weapon in combat, a rope to climb, or an old book to understand a legend. This often grants you a Gear Bonus. You roll Gear Dice together with Base Dice and Skill Dice, and they are counted the same way: sixes equal x.

**GEAR GETS WORN**  
Gear can get worn in one of two ways: 1) Reduced Gear Dice, 2) Reduced Reliable rating.

GEAR DICE
When you use gear and push your roll (see above), there is a risk your gear may be damaged. For every SKULL you roll with your Gear Dice when pushing the roll, the item’s Gear Bonus is decreased by one. It simply doesn’t work as well anymore – a weapon dulls, a rope frays, the fragile pages of a book fall out and crumble to pieces. If the Gear Bonus reaches zero, the item is broken and cannot be used again until repaired.  

RELIABILITY RATING
Some gear, like modern firearms, are more complex tools are more reliable, and banes on their pushed Gear Dice decrease their "Reliable" rating instead of reduce Gear Dice. This kind of gear can suffer damage and be broken through use or attacks. Each point of damage from pushing rolls or outside force will reduce the Reliable
rating by 1. When it reaches zero, the item is broken and can no longer be used. A typical piece of sturdy, mechanical gear in good condition has a reliability rating of 5, but delicate or badly built gear can start with a lower rating. **If the item has no Gear Dice, and no reliability is listed, assume Reliability to be 5.**

REPAIRS
Luckily, damaged gear can be repaired. It takes about a quarter day of work, tools (T2K p130) of some sort, and a successful roll with the TECHNICAL or CRAFTING skill. For modern machinery, you'll also need a **spare part** (page 130) of the relevant type: vehicle, weapon, electronic – or general, if none of the others apply.
If the roll is successful, the Gear Bonus or Reliable rating is recovered by one point for every X, up to the starting value. 
If a TECHNICAL roll fails, you can simply try again next quarter day. Banes on a pushed TECHNICAL roll for repairs result in a permanently reduced Reliable rating.
If a CRAFTING roll fails, the Gear Bonus is permanently decreased to its current score. If the Gear Bonus has been reduced to zero and the attempt at repair fails, the item is permanently destroyed. 

More on worn gear and repairing it can be found in the [Gear](Gear.md) section.
### **PRIDE**  
Once per game session, you can use your Pride when you have failed a skill roll. When you use your Pride, roll a D12 and add the result to your roll. You can activate your Pride no matter whether you have pushed the roll or not, but you cannot push the roll after using your Pride. If you fail despite using your Pride, you must erase your Pride. You must play a whole game session without Pride, then you can choose a new one.

### **DEVELOPLING YOUR CHARACTER**  
You can **spend your XP** to improve your Attributes, Skills and Talents, or to learn new ones. You can only spend XP during a Quarter Day when you REST or SLEEP.

SKILLS
To increase a skill level by one step costs a number of XP equal to the skill level you want to attain multiplied by 5. For example, an increase from skill level 2 to 3 costs 15 XP. You can only increase a skill level one step at a time. Learning a new skill (at skill level 1) costs 5 XP. Also, you must either have used the skill and succeeded (without skill level) during the session, or be instructed by a teacher (at skill level 1 or more) during a Quarter Day. See the table below for XP costs.

| Desired Skill level | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **XP Cost**         | 5   | 10  | 15  | 20  | 25  | 30  | 35  | 40  | 45  | 50  |

SPECIALIZATIONS
Specializations, if improved upon, detach from their parent skill and are treated like their own, cheaper, more focused skill. 

To increase a specialization by one step costs a certain number of XP:
	From 1-4, multiply the skill level you want to attain multiplied by 1.5 (rounded up). 
	For 5, the cost is 10  
	For all higher skill levels, multiply the desired level by 2.5 (rounded down)  
You can only increase a Specialization one step at a time. Also, you must either have used the specialization and succeeded (without skill level) during the session, or be instructed by a teacher with a higher skill than you during a Quarter Day. See the table below for XP costs.

| Desired Specialty Level | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **XP Cost**             | 2   | 3   | 5   | 6   | 10  | 15  | 17  | 20  | 22  | 25  |

ATTRIBUTES
To increase a given Attribute by one step costs a number of XP equal to the cost of increasing _each skill under the attribute_ by one, plus the Attribute level you want to attain multiplied by 3. The skill levels remain unchanged. Training time is 5 quarter days. These quarter days may be broken up, but all 5 must take place within 1 week.  
_e.g. Kivil wants to improve his EMPATHY from 2 to 3. He has Manipulation 0, Performance 1, Healing 0, Animal Handing 0. Total cost of improving EMPATHY would be 34xp (25 for skills, 9 for attribute). The skill levels remain unchanged._

GAIN A TALENT 
Talents do not contain ranks or levels, so cannot be improved. You may gain a new talents by either a Quarter Day of practice, or a plot event that makes sense to explain gaining a talent, then a successful Wits roll, and spending 10 XP. 

# **THE SKILLS**  
This section describes the 17 skills in this game.

**Difficulty Modifiers**: Under each skill, more difficult uses of the skill are described. Each section lists a DM "Difficulty Modifier" in the form of a die penalty and a number of successes, e.g. "-3 / XXX". This indicates that there are two routes of achieving the difficult effect: 1) intentionally attempting that difficult effect will result in a die penalty to your roll. 2) rolling your full die pool and "accidentally" achieving a difficult feat by achieving multiple successes. 
>Note that the probability of achieving a difficult feat is higher if you intentionally aim for it (choosing the die penalty). With 7 dice, achieving 1 success at -3 is 52%. With 7 dice, achieving XXX is 10%.
## **STRENGTH**
## **MIGHT**
You use MIGHT to lift, pull, push, or hold tight to something. If your roll succeeds, you perform this feat of strength.

Might Specializations
>Grappler: Grapple attacks, Breaking free or holding an opponent in Grapple  
>Lifter: Lifting or holding heavy objects  
>Hard Hitter: When using Swing Weapon action. (Heavy Weapon Fighter)  
>Intimidating: When using Might instead of Influence to intimidate (Threatening)   
>Steady: When resisting tackles or disarms (Firm Grip)  

| General MIGHT Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | DM         |

**Special MIGHT Actions**

GRAPPLING: Engaging into a grapple is a MELEE roll, but when a grapple has succeeded, the only action a grappled person can perform is BREAK FREE – which is a slow action and requires them winning an opposed MELEE or MIGHT: Grappler  roll. While you are grappling, the only action you can perform is a GRAPPLE ATTACK. It works like PUNCH/KICK/BITE, but is a fast action and cannot be DODGED or PARRIED.

LIFTING: Rolling MIGHT for lifting is only necessary if the attempt is significant or under pressure. One successful roll allows them to carry the object for up to 6 rounds (30 seconds). One success means you can do nothing but carry the weight. More successes, you can do other actions as well. Failure means they must put the object down or suffer 1 Stress Point

| Lbs    | Kilograms | Example                   | DM  |       |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------- | --- | ----- |
| 60-120 | 30-50     |                           | -   | X     |
| 220    | 100       | 2 cement bags             | -1  | XX    |
| 440    | 200       | motorcycle, 4 cement bags | -3  | XXX   |
| 1100   | 500       | horse, grand piano        | -5  | XXXX  |
| 1650   | 750       | half a small car          | -7  | XXXXX |

SWING WEAPON ACTION: A Fast action that must be performed directly before a SLASH or STAB, in the same round. You swing your HEAVY melee weapon to make your upcoming strike more powerful. No roll is required, and grants your next successful strike +1 damage
You may optionally perform a "Mighty Swing" by roll MIGHT during this action. The result of successes can be varied. Refer to the table below for effects, which may be intended (1 success, including the appropriate modifier), or lucky (no modifiers, but you've rolled the appropriate number of successes). Note that if you roll MIGHT with no modifiers, 1 success has no effect.

| **Wirlwind:** If you down an enemy with a swing weapon attack, you may perform a free run action and repeat the attack as a free action.                                                                             | -7 / XXXXX |

INTIMIDATING: At a -3 penalty (or rolling XXX successes), you may use MIGHT instead of INFLUENCE when you threaten someone to make them do what you want. If successful, they cannot demand anything in return but can choose to attack. 

## **ENDURANCE**
When the road is long and hard, when your legs can’t carry you any longer, roll for ENDURANCE. Roll for this skill when you travel in extreme weather or when you are forced to suffer bitter cold. If you succeed, you push through the pain and can fight on for a while longer.

**Special ENDURANCE Actions**

RESISTING TORTURE: Some may attempt to inflict pain compliance upon you without injuring you, they must roll MELEE, CRAFTING, or MEDICAL AID vs. your ENDURANCE successfully as many times as the your ENDURANCE skill, spread out over an equal number of hours. They must spend 15 minutes every hour torturing you, or the process begins anew. 
The torturer's Failure will lead the subject to become STR BROKEN and pass out. Success leads the subject to PANIC: begin begging pathetically, and tell them whatever the fuck will make them happy, and must roll for a permanent mental trauma. 

## **MELEE**
To be able to defend yourself with weapon in hand, or barehanded. Roll MELEE when you attack or parry in close combat. If the roll succeeds, you hit your adversary and do Weapon Damage.

**Special MELEE Actions**

CHARGE ATTACK: Move from 10m to Arm's Length (fast action) then performing a SLASH, STAB, PUNCH, or SHOVE (slow action). This combination is recognized in order to give the Charger specialization a die bonus.

DISARM: You try to knock the weapon from your opponent’s hands. Roll MELEE and your weapon’s Gear Bonus. Disarming an opponent wielding a one-handed weapon requires one X, a two-handed weapon requires XX. If you succeed, your opponent drops their weapon, which lands at ARM’S LENGTH. You cannot DISARM a shield. Your enemy can PARRY or DODGE your DISARM.

GRAPPLE: You grab hold of your opponent. Roll for MELEE, as no weapon can be used. Can be DODGED or PARRIED. If the attack succeeds, both you and your opponent fall to the ground. The opponent drops any weapon they were hold- ing, and cannot move. The only action they can perform is **BREAK FREE** – which is a slow action and requires them winning an opposed MELEE or MIGHT against you. While you are grappling, the only action you can perform is a **GRAPPLE ATTACK.** It works like PUNCH/KICK/BITE, but is a fast action and cannot be DODGED or PARRIED.

PARRY: You block your opponent’s attack. Fast Reactive action. Requires a shield or a weapon. Roll MELEE and the Gear Bonus of the shield or weapon used. If you PARRY with a weapon that lacks the PARRYING feature, you get a –2 penalty. If the attacker STABS you, you get a +2 bonus when you PARRY with a shield but a –2 penalty if you parry with a weapon. Every X you roll eliminates a X from the attacker’s roll. Any excess X have no effect.  
- Parrying Ranged Attacks: you must either have a weapon with the PARRYING feature and take a -3 penalty, or use a shield. Roll using MELEE and the Gear Bonus. Every X you roll eliminates one X from the attacker’s roll. Any excess X have no effect. Only shields can parry firearm attacks. 
- Sacrificing Shield: When using a PARRY action with a shield, the character can choose to discard the shield to reduce all damage from the parried attack to zero if it had at least one success on the PARRY roll. This leaves the shield completely broken.

PUNCH/KICK/BITE: Slow Action. Does not require a weapon. Roll for MELEE. Can be DODGED or PARRIED, and any attempt to PARRY gets a +2 bonus. If you hit, your opponent takes 1 point of damage to his Strength. If you roll multiple x, the damage increases by one for each additional x. If the enemy suffers a critical injury, roll on the table for blunt force wounds (unless you have fangs – in that case, use the table for slash wounds).

SHOVE: You try to push your enemy prone, or back 1 meter. Roll MELEE. A weapon with the HOOK feature or a shield can be used (add the item’s Gear Bonus). If your opponent has higher Strength than you, two X are required to succeed, otherwise one is enough. If they roll MOVE at -5 / XXXX, any shove attempt fails. If the attack is successful, your opponent falls to the ground and is prone. Any additional X have no effect. Your opponent can DODGE to avoid your SHOVE. PARRYING a SHOVE requires a shield.

SLASH: Slow Action. SLASH and STAB will do the same amount of damage if they hit. SLASHING requires a weapon with the EDGED or BLUNT features. DODGING a SLASH gets a +2 bonus. If the enemy takes a critical injury roll on the table for slash wounds (for EDGED weapons) or blunt trauma (for BLUNT weapons).

STAB: Slow Action. STAB and SLASH will do the same amount of damage if they hit. Requires a weapon with the POINTED feature. PARRYING a STAB with a weapon suffers -2 penalty, but using a shield gains a +2 bonus. If the enemy suffers a critical injury, roll on the table for stab wounds. Stabbing is good for enemies without shields.

TACKLE ACTION: Slow Action. Melee -3 / XXX. Tackle an opponent within SHORT range to the ground. If the opponent’s Strength is higher than yours, he can make a MIGHT roll (not an action) to stay on his feet. You both drop what you’re holding, both on ground, they’re now considered GRAPPLED. No effect on creatures with STR 8+.
## **AGILITY**
## **STEALTH**
It is often wise to avoid combat and sneak past the enemy instead. Roll an opposed roll with your STEALTH skill against your adversary’s OBSERVATION. If you win, you manage to sneak past them without being spotted. You can also use this skill to remain hidden and avoid discovery when you are stationary. A third way to use this skill is to make a **Sneak Attacks** and **Ambushes** (see [Combat and Damage](Combat%20and%20Damage.md)).

| **Flip:** If you successfully negate an attack by dodging and remaining standing, you may at the same time move 10m                                                                                                                 | -3 / XXX  |

| **Fast Kip:** Allows you to get up from prone position without spending an action. If successful, you are standing, and may now perform a Kick as a Fast Action. Failure means you've used a Fast Action, and remain on the ground. | -5 / XXXX |
| **Fall roll:** Reduce the damage taken from a fall. Reduce 4 damage, and you may use up to 4 Willpower, each reducing 1 more damage.                                                                                                | -5 / XXXX |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| **Protective Parry**. When a friend within 10m range is attacked, you may PARRY the attack for him. Your PARRY follows the normal rules and counts as one of your actions in the round. Any unparried damage continues to the intended target, not you.                              | -3 / XX   |
| **Bodily Replace**. Immediately switch places with an ally within 10m engaged in battle. The movement can’t be made through walls or in other ways that would break the laws of physics. Does not count as an action for your ally.                                                  | -4 / XXX  |
| **Body Block**. You may attempt this action at any time, throwing yourself in front of an ally within 10m distance who is being attacked, and suffer 1 damage instead of your friend. If successful, you may add Willpower points, taking on 1 more damage for every Willpower used. | -5 / XXXX |

DODGE: You throw yourself out of the way of your opponent’s melee or ranged attack. Fast action, Reactive action. Roll MOVE: Fast Footwork. You cannot use a weapon. If the attacker SLASHES, you get a +2 bonus. Every X you roll eliminates a X from the attacker’s roll. There are 3 kinds of Dodge:
1) Standing Dodge. MOVE -2 vs 1 attack, remain standing. If you remain standing and you've negated all damage with a -3 penalty, OR roll XX beyond all damage negation, you may at the same time move 10m. Acrobatic flip!
2) Dropping Dodge. MOVE vs 1 attack, fall prone, imposing an additional -1 penalty on all attacks beyond 10m.
3) Flying Dodge. MOVE +2 vs all attacks, fall prone 3m away, take no actions (besides stand) next round if it’s a reaction.

DODGING GUNFIRE: If you are aware of an imminent firearms attack against you (you see someone lift their weapon to fire at you), you may perform a Reaction to DODGE their attack. Note that if their gunfire is what is alerting you to being targeted, it is too late to DODGE their first attack, but as a Reaction, you may still:
	a) Hit the dirt. Fast Action, no roll needed. You go prone, imposing a -1 penalty on anyone attacking further than Short Range (10m).  
	b) Seek Cover. Fast Action. Roll MOVE. If the terrain allows it, immediately take full or partial cover behind a barrier. Under partial cover, the barrier is essentially armor. Under full cover, enemies can rarely even target you.   

If it is your turn, and you are reasonably sure that you're about to be fired upon in the next round, you have more options:
	a) Dodge pre-emptively. Your dodge roll will apply to the next ranged attack against you.  
	b) Keep moving. An attacker suffers a -1 penalty if you've moved since their last round.  
	c) Hit the dirt. As a free action, you may go prone, imposing a -1 penalty on anyone further than 10m.  
	d) Seek cover. If the terrain allows it, immediately take full or partial cover behind a barrier. Under partial cover, the barrier is essentially armor. Under full cover, enemies can rarely even target you.  

DIRTY FIGHTING: Essentially the FEINT Action. Fast Action. Specialization MOVE: Dirty Fighter.

| **Hard Feint**: When you use the feint action, roll MOVE, and you may instead of trading initiative cards, have the target lose all actions if you damage it with the next attack you take this round.                                                                                                                | -2 / XX  |
| **Distant Feint**: Use the feint action within Short range of your enemy. Also, when you use the feint action, you may instead of trading initiative cards, have the target be unable to dodge or parry the next action you take this round.                                                                          | -3 / XXX |
| **Blind Target**: When you use the feint action, you may instead of trading initiative cards, throw dust in your opponents’ eyes as a sleight of hands roll. It counts as a piercing projectile attack for the purpose of parry/dodge. On a success the target is blinded, as if in total darkness for 1 round per x. | -4 / XXX |

SEEK COVER: Fast action. Reactive. Roll MOVE: Fast Footwork. Requires terrain within 10m that can provide cover. This will provide protective cover against gunfire. 
## **MARKSMANSHIP**
Using a firearm, bow and arrow, sling, or a simple rock, you can stop enemies at a distance and can avoid bloodying your hands. Roll MARKSMANSHIP when you throw or fire a weapon at an enemy at a distance. If you succeed, the shot hits its target and you do weapon damage to your enemy.

**Special MARKSMANSHIP Actions**

CALLED SHOT: If you want your attack to hit a specific part of your target’s body – the head, the torso, a leg or an arm – you need to make a called shot. Called shots suffer a –2 modifier. If the body part has no armor, you bypass any armor rolls. If the body part is partially armored, the GM rolls for whether the armor was hit. To intentionally hit an exposed body part smaller than the major categories, suffer -3 (face-sized area), or -4 (eyeball-sized area).

## **WITS**
## **OBSERVATION**
You use your OBSERVATION skill to discover anyone sneaking up on you (opposed roll, see above). You can also use this skill when you see something or someone at a distance, and want to know more about it. If the roll is successful, you see what it is and can determine whether or not it is a threat to you. The GM decides exactly what you see. OBSERVATION can be used to fight in the dark ([Combat and Damage](Combat%20and%20Damage.md)), Keep Watch ([Journeys](Journeys.md)), Surveying new land ([Journeys](Journeys.md)), and investigating mysterious scenes.

DON’T USE OBSERVATION TO FIND HIDDEN THINGS: The OBSERVATION skill is not used to find hidden things like secret doors or hidden clues. If you describe how your PC searches the right place, the GM should simply let you discover what you are looking for if it is possible to find.

GROUP OBSERVATION  
When you and other adventurers OBSERVE at the same time, you do not roll separately. Instead, only one PC rolls. You decide together who should roll. Helping is not allowed. The result applies to the whole group.

Observation Specialties
>Forward Observer: Directing indirect fire  
>Military Intel: Knowing stats of military weapons, troops, vehicles  
>Investigator: Investigation of scenes of crime or battle  
>Scout: spotting others or avoiding danger, ambushes and sneak attacks (sixth sense)  
>Surveyor: When using the Survey The Land action.

**Special OBSERVATION Actions**

FORWARD OBSERVER: Slow Action. Communicating with a marksman while directing indirect fire (parabolic ranged attacks on targets outside marksman's line of sight). It needs to be done before the weapon is aimed (this can be a good opportunity to exchange initiatives). If the spotter’s roll fails, the indirect fire will automatically deviate. If the spotter succeeds, the gunner resolves the attack normally. Extra X on the spotter’s roll have no effect. The spotter can call in corrections (each correction gives a +1 to the next attack against the same target, up to a maximum bonus of +3). This is a slow action and requires no dice roll. After corrections have been called in, the gunner needs to spend a slow action correcting their aim.

SURVEY THE LAND: 1 QD. OBSERVATION: Surveyor. Modified by visibility. You can survey a hex for valuable features of the terrain or interesting hidden locales. Only one individual becomes the lead surveyor. Others may assist in this roll, but note that this roll does NOT have the same effect as KEEP WATCH. It’s a good idea to retain a lookout. Surveyor may KEEP WATCH as well, with -1 penalty for both rolls. On a success, find a hidden adventure site in the hex and roll on the Feature Table. The GM makes a roll for a complication AND a regular encounter roll. You will find tracks or other signs from any complication in time, unless otherwise stated by in the description of the complication. The first successful survey rolls D66. The 2nd successful survey rolls D66 twice and takes the lowest roll. Roll as many D66 as the number of Surveys, always taking the lowest result. Same with Complications. On a failed roll, nothing happens. You will automatically fail any further attempts to survey the same area for a week. A BANE/SKULL on a PUSHED roll: Any complication spots the party before they spot it or any tracks of it. It can choose to ambush the party, or make itself known. A complication that can call for aid within the Quarter day, may do so, becoming larger or more organized. See [Journeys](Journeys.md) for more info.
## **SURVIVAL**
In the wilderness, or the city, the ignorant can lose their lives by making the wrong choices. You can roll SURVIVAL in a number of different situations when you are traveling in the wilderness (finding your way, building a camp, hunting for food, tracking prey, even basic farming and cooking, etc.) See [Journeys](Journeys.md) for more detail on these. You can even use SURVIVAL for First Aid, which incurs a -3 penalty compared to the MEDICAL AID skill.

Survival Specialties
>Cook: Turning raw food into rations  
>First Aid: when using SURVIVAL to heal someone. This use incurs a -3 penalty compared to the MEDICAL AID skill  
>Farmer: farming  
>Angler: fishing  
>Forager: foraging for food or herbs  
>Hunter: Hunting for food  
>Navigator: Leading the way by water or air   
>Pathfinder: Leading the way on land    
>Quartermaster: Making camp and establishing a home base.   
>Scrounger: Scrounging urban areas or ruins for useful scrap  
>(CHOOSE ENVIRONMENT): Forest, Desert, Mountains, Plains, etc. Use this specialization when FORAGING, HUNTING, LEADING THE WAY, or rolling for ENDURANCE in this chosen environment

**Special SURVIVAL Actions**

COOKING: With 1 roll, turn 1 unit of raw Meat, Fish, or Vegetables becomes 3 Field Rations. Over a campfire takes 1QD. In a proper kitchen, takes 30 minutes, though 1 single roll can count for a full QD, turning into 4 units of raw food into 12 Rations.  
For Brewing and more advanced meals, see CRAFTING; Chef. You may use SURVIVAL: Cook to attempt brewing or advanced meals rolls, but they incur a -3 penalty.

FIRST AID: Slow Action. Gear required. You may use SURVIVAL: First Aid for rolls to revive a Broken character. However, using SURVIVAL: First Aid in order to stabilize fatal critical injuries, treat long-term critical injuries, or illnesses, poisons, and other damage incurs a -3 penalty compared to the MEDICAL AID skill.   

FARMING: More info later.

FISHING: 1 QD. Gear required. SURVIVAL: Angler. Catch a number of units of FISH equal to the number of x you rolled. You cannot HIKE while FISHING, but you can FISH from a moving boat. If your roll fails, you don’t catch any FISH and if failure includes a SKULL/BANE, roll on the Fishing Mishap Table. See [Journeys](Journeys.md) for more info.

FORAGING: 1QD. SURVIVAL: Forager. Modified by environmental conditions. Searching for food, water, or herbs (-2 / XX). Success for food means that you find a number of units of VEGETABLES in the form of edible roots or plants, equal to the number of X you rolled. Success for water means you find drinkable water. Success for herbs means you've found 1/4 unit of Herbs. If your FORAGE roll fails, you don’t find any anything. If failure includes a SKULL/BANE result, roll on the FORAGING MISHAPS TABLE. See [Journeys](Journeys.md) for more info.

| SURVIVAL: Forager Effects             | DM       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Foraging for Herbs                    | -2 / XX  |
| Double the amount of vegetables found | -4 / XXX |

HUNTING: 1 QD. Modified by environmental conditions. HUNTING and HIKING at the same time yields a -1 DM. You need some form of gear to HUNT- either a ranged weapon or a hunting trap of some type. First, you must find your prey, which you can do by making a SURVIVAL: Hunter roll. Success means that you find some kind of prey. Roll on the PREY TABLE in [Journeys](Journeys.md) to see what type of animal it is. If you roll multiple X, you can re-roll on the hunting table once per extra X. To kill your prey you must roll again, this time for MARKSMANSHIP (if using a weapon) or SURVIVAL again (if you are using a trap). Modify the roll with the difficulty of the animal, according to the table. You don’t need to fight the animal, rolling once is enough. Note that some animals cannot be caught with a trap. If a failure includes a SKULL, roll on the Hunting Mishaps table. If your second roll fails to kill your prey, and the prey is an aggressive creature, it immediately attacks you. See [Journeys](Journeys.md) for more info.

| You may roll two D6s on the animals table and choose which result you want to use. | -4 / XXX |

PATHFINDING/NAVIGATING: 1 QD. Modified by visibility conditions. PATHFINDING/NAVIGATING and doing anything else at the same time yields a -1 DM for both actions. Every time you enter a new hexagon on the map, the pathfinder makes a SURVIVAL: Pathfinder (SURVIVAL: Navigator for water travel) roll. Success means you find a viable path into the hexagon and you move on without any problems. Failure means that you still enter the hexagon, but you suffer a mishap and must immediately roll on the appropriate travel mishap table. If heading toward a visible landmark, there is no chance of the “Lost” result in the mishap table. Traveling on trails grants +2 DM. Travel on roads requires no roll. See [Journeys](Journeys.md) for more info.

MAKE CAMP: 1QD. Modified by weather conditions. When the journey of the day is over, it’s time to MAKE CAMP. Finding a good location for a camp, making a fire, shelter, and preparing where to SLEEP. Only one person rolls to MAKE CAMP , but others can help. Make a SURVIVAL: Quartermaster roll. If your roll succeeds, you find a sheltered and comfortable place to spend the night, where you can all rest up before the next day’s journey. If your roll fails, your camp is less pleasant; you may still REST, but SLEEP requires another SURVIVAL roll (see SLEEPING ON BARE GROUND). If failure includes a SKULL/BANE, roll on the Make Camp Mishap Table. When making camp for more than 10 travelers, MAKING CAMP takes +2h for every 5 more travelers. See [Journeys](Journeys.md) for more info.

| SURVIVAL: Quartermaster Effects                                               | DM        |

| -2h from the time it takes to MAKE CAMP. Minimum 3h.                          | -3 / XXX  |
| When you have MADE CAMP, the person KEEPINGWATCH gets a +2 bonus to SCOUTING. | -3 / XXX  |
| -3h from the time it takes to MAKE CAMP. Minimum 3h.                          | -4 / XXXX |
| -4h from the time it takes to MAKE CAMP. Minumum 3h.                          | -5 / XXXX |

SCROUNGING: 1 QD. SURVIVAL: Scrounger. Modified by terrain type. Scrounging involves searching the refuse of civilization for useful items, material, and spare parts. This can be done in the streets of a living city, the ruins of a dead one (1 km area), or in rural areas (10km area), but not in the wilderness. Every X allows a roll on [the scrap table](the%20scrap%20table.md). Failure yields nothing. See [Journeys](Journeys.md) for more info.
## **CRAFTING**
A catch-all skill covering the know-how and attention to detail required for crafts common to pre-modern eras. For modern or high-tech items, the skill to use is TECHNICAL.

Crafting Specialties
>Smith: metalworking, forging, casting, molding, and smelting.  
>Builder: Masonry/carpentry, base/stronghold building  
>Apothecary- Crafting herbal concoctions: poisons, remedies, stimulants
>Cartography- crafting maps
>Bowyer- Crafting bows and slings
>Chef: Crafting food and alcohol  
>Tanner: turning pelts into leather, or leather into clothes and armor  
>Tailor: crafting cloth or clothes  
>Demolitions: placing and disarming mines and explosive devices  
>Jury-Rigging: Crafting makeshift modern or high-tech gear at a -2 DM
 
CRAFT: Creating new items requires far more work than repairing existing ones does. It re-quires a CRAFTING roll (and the right talent, for ADVANCED items) just like repairing, but you also need raw material, in most cases special tools, and usually a lot more time. Some items are very complicated to craft and the roll will be modified negatively. All these requirements and prerequisites can be found in the gear tables in Chapter 9. Note that some raw materials might be items which in turn must be crafted.

If your roll is **successful**, you make the item, of the same quality as listed in the equipment lists. You may push any CRAFTING roll, but after a push, all banes count against the item’s gear bonus. If the roll is **failed** and the gear bonus has been pushed to 0, the materials are destroyed. If you are crafting an item that doesn’t posess “gear bonus”, 2 banes will destroy the materials after a failed roll. If successful, but you still have banes after a push (on an item with no “gear bonus”) the item is simply of inferior quality. If you **fail**, take a -2 penalty on your next crafting roll to create the same type of item for a week, unless you can change or improve the circumstances, like getting better at crafting, getting better assistance or better tools.

CRAFTING CONSUMABLES: Some craftable items, like poisons, are going to use up materials on a regular failure. In this case, the crafter looses 1/2 of the starting materials.

ADDITIONAL TIME: By spending more time than the minimum required to craft an item, you increase your chance of success. If you spend twice as much time as the require- ment, you get a +1 modification on your roll, and if you spend four times as much time, you get a +2 modification. You cannot get a higher modification than +2 by spending ad- ditional time.

MASTER CRAFTING: Skilled craftsmen can create items above and beyond what a normal craftsman can. Using talents, you can create items with better game stats than normal. Read more in Chapter 4.

NEW ITEMS: You can attempt to craft items that are not listed in the weapons and gear lists. You can determine the item’s properties and the require- ments to craft it in consultation with the GM. The GM has the final word.

**Special CRAFTING Actions**

DEMOLITIONS: Placing and disarming mines and explosive devices using CRAFTING: Demolitions incurs a -1 DM when compared to using the more appropriate skill, TECHNICAL: Demolitions. This increased DM is reflected in the chart below. See [Combat and Damage](Combat%20and%20Damage.md) for more in Explosives.

REPAIR: Repairing a broken item generally takes a few hours and a successful CRAFTING roll at the same DM as it took to craft the item. If the roll succeeds, the item is repaired. If the item has a Gear Bonus, it will increase one step for every x rolled. You cannot go above the original Gear Bonus. If you fail at your task, you may not try again on this item until it has been repaired by someone else. The item is unaffected. BANES when PUSHING a repair roll mean if you did not completely fix the item, the item’s Gear Bonus is permanently decreased to the current level. Every BANE beyond the first one lowers the Gear Bonus permanently by 1. If the Gear Bonus has been decreased to zero, the item is permanently destroyed. 

**INVENTING NEW TECHNOLOGY:** The case may be that a PC in a premodern setting wishes to create an item that may require more technical knowledge than currently exists in their setting. e.g. for a 12th Century setting,  printing press, glider, cannon, microscope, etc.  
Creating a complex new invention requires rank 3 in a specialty most relevant to the machine, building material, or technique that you’re trying to invent. If the GM determines that there is no specialty relevant to what you’re trying to create, the alternative prerequisite is to have the base CRAFTING skill at rank 5. If you only have rank 5 CRAFTING, your initial attempt will be at a -4 penalty, and all subsequent attempts will be at -2. But if you get rank 3 in the relevant specialty, your initial attempt will be at a -2 penalty due to the difficulty of making something that’s never been done before, and all subsequent attempts will have no penalty.  
- The following are example specialties that are related to technical expertise which can be used to push beyond the age’s tech level: Alchemist, Apothecary, Bowyer, Builder, Cartography, Chef, Physician, Smith, Tailor, Tanner.  
- The GM will determine the material and tool requirements as well as time-taken to create your prototype.

JURY RIGGING: Using CRAFTING: Jury-Rigging incurs a -2 DM compared to using TECHNICAL: Jury-Rigging. Only certain types of modern and high-tech gear can be jury-rigged from spare parts. This includes crude weapons, but also larger items such as stills for distilling fuel. Jury rigging an item requires number of Quarter Days of work and spare parts as indicated by the item’s description. You can try again if you fail. 
## **SCHOLAR**
Roll for SCHOLAR when you want to know more about a subject, site, an important NPC or artifact. If you succeed, you will remember something important about it. With specialized subjects, a challenging roll (-2, or XX) will grant a +1 modification for another skill roll related to the subject, or a skill roll saliently enhanced by knowledge of the subject.

ROLLING FOR CONTACTS / CONNECTIONS  
In any given faction or group, a character might know people- how to acquire information, items, or favors. When attempting to inquire into specific contacts that have not been already narratively established, a character may roll SCHOLAR: Streetwise (or any other specialty that seems relevant, e.g. Business for corporate contacts). Their roll is then modified by their FACTION SCORE: a dice number representing how well they connected in good terms with the faction. 

| Level of Familiarity / Good-Standing | Description                                                                                  | Modifier |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1. Outsider                          | Basic awareness of the faction; limited understanding of its inner workings.                 | +1       |
| 2. Observer                          | Some familiarity with faction customs and dynamics; can recognize key figures occasionally.  | +2       |
| 3. Familiar                          | Good grasp of the faction's structure and interactions; has a sense of who holds influence.  | +3       |
| 4. Insider                           | Strong understanding of the faction’s politics and social order; recognizes subtle dynamics. | +4       |
| 5. Embedded                          | Deeply attuned to the faction’s culture; effortlessly interprets power shifts and nuances.   | +5       |
For factions that they don't have explicit connections to, judge the modifier based on the size and type of faction:

| Faction size <br>and type | Public | Illegal | Secret |

## **TECHNICAL**
Roll TECHNICAL when repairing, crafting, or modifying modern or high technology. In almost every case, specialized tools are absolutely necessary. 

Technical Specialties
>Chemist: crafting or identifying chemicals  
>Demolitions: placing and disarming mines and explosive devices  
>Communications: using radios, boosting signals, morse code, setting up antennae, using encryption equipment 
>Computers: using computers, programming, hacking, etc.  
>Electrician: wiring, soldering, disabling, and repairing electrical devices.  
>Gunsmith: repairing firearms  
>Locksmith: picking locks, cracking safes, and disarming alarms.  
>Mechanic: repairing engines, vehicles, generators, pumps.  
>Jury-Rigging: Crafting makeshift modern or high-tech gear.

CRAFTING: Crafting modern or high technology uses TECHNICAL, similarly to general crafting rules, with some slight differences. 
- You will almost always require specialized tools, a garage, or workshop.  
- -2 DM is applied with the exception of jury-rigging.  
- Many items are too complex to be made from scratch, so instead of crafting from raw materials, you will need a certain number of SPARE PARTS of the relevant type: vehicle, weapon, electronic – or general, if none of the others apply.  
- If the roll succeeds, you complete the item with a reliability rating 2 points lower than the “original” (down to a minimum of 1) plus 1 for each X rolled beyond the first (to a maximum of the original reliability). The reliability rating achieved during manufacturing is the maximum for the item.  
- The requirements in time and materials to manufacture an item vary immensely, but some general guidelines follow below.   

WEAPONS: The time requirement ranges from about a week for small arms, to several weeks for heavy weapons. You also need spare parts with a total weight equal to the weight of the item, evenly divided between general spare parts and weapon spare parts. Some weapons might also require electronic spare parts (Referee’s discretion). Ammunition is not included. Some examples of spare part requirements:  
- PISTOL: 1 weapon  
- SHOTGUN: 1 general and 1 weapon  
- ATRL: 2 general and 2 weapon  
- HMG: 4 general and 4 weapon  
- MORTAR (82mm): 8 general and 8 weapon  

AMMUNITION: To manufacture ammunition, you need general spare parts and explosives in equal weight,
totaling the same weight as the ammunition you want to produce. In a workshop, you can produce one encumbrance units’ worth of ammo per shift of work for each X you roll on your TECHNICAL roll. Be careful though – if you fail a roll, immediately roll again. If the second roll also fails, you trigger an explosion with a blast power equal to the type of round you are making (D for non-explosive).  

VEHICLES: The time requirement ranges from about a week for a bicycle or motorcycle, to several weeks for larger vehicles. You also need spare parts with a total weight equal to the weight of the vehicle, evenly divided between general spare parts and vehicle spare parts. Most vehicles also require some electronic spare parts. Vehicle-mounted weapons are not included when building a vehicle – these must be built separately in a workshop. Some examples of spare part requirements:  
- BICYCLE: 2 general, 2 vehicle  
- DIRTBIKE: 25 general, 25 vehicle, 1 electronic  
- PICKUP TRUCK: 150 general, 150 vehicle, 5 electronic  
- APC: 1,500 general, 1,500 vehicle, 10 electronic

Once the bliss dies down, the attention is sustained firmly upon the meditative object; and you achieve śamatha that is freed from the turbulence caused by great pleasure. | -7 / XXXXX |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**Various INFLUENCE Actions**

MANIPULATION
Make an opposed roll with your INFLUENCE: Manipulation against your adversary’s INSIGHT. Your chances are affected both by your negotiating position. What you ask of your opponent or what you want them to do must be within reason – **no NPC will agree to do anything or act completely against their own interests**, no matter how good your roll is.

RESOLUTION  
If you succeed, your adversary must either do what you want or immediately attack you physically. Even if your adversary chooses to do what you want, he can still demand something in return. The GM decides what that entails, but it should be reasonable enough for you to be able to meet those demands. It is up to you to accept the agreement or not.

NEGOTIATING POSITION  
Your chances of MANIPULATING someone successfully are affected by your negotiating position, which is determined by the GM. Each of following factors modifies your roll by +1:  
+ You have more people on your side.  
+ What you ask for doesn’t cost your opponent anything.  
+ Your opponent has suffered damage to any attribute.  
+ You have helped your opponent previously.  
+ You present your case very well (determined by the GM)  
+ You have more reputation (Village or Regional, whichever is highest) than your opponent.  
+ You have twice the reputation (Village or Regional, whichever is highest) than your opponent.  
+ You have more Global reputation than your opponent

Each of the following factors modifies your roll by –1.  
- Your opponent has more people on their side.  
+ Your opponent has more reputation (Village or Regional, whichever is highest) than you.  
+ Your opponent has twice the reputation (Village or Regional, whichever is highest) than you.  
+ Your opponent has more Global reputation than you.
- You ask for something valuable or dangerous.  
- Your opponent has nothing to gain by helping you.  
- You are having trouble understanding each other.  
- The range between you is SHORT or longer.
- You are trying to communicate through an unlearned language: -5 DM
		DM further modified by language rarity: 
		- Common Languages (Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese) -1  
		- Uncommon Languages (Russian, Bengali, Italian, Korean, German, etc) -2  
		- Rare Languages (Nahuatl, Pashto, Gaelic, Uyghur, etc)  -3  

MANIPULATE A GROUP  
When you want to MANIPULATE a whole group, you usually address the group’s leader or spokesperson. Remember that your roll is modified by –1 if your opponent has more people on their side. If you reach an agreement with the leader, the rest of the group usually follows. If there is no given leader it’s harder — every single opponent acts individually.

BEING MANIPULATED  
NPCs and other PCs can MANIPULATE you. If their roll succeeds, you must attack or offer a deal of some kind. Then it is up to the GM (or the other player) whether your adversary accepts or not.

NOT MIND CONTROL  
When you MANIPULATE someone, you do not take control of their mind. What you are trying to convince your adversary about must be somewhat reasonable, otherwise the GM can disallow it.

| **Taunt Enemies:** Roll an opposed roll for INFLUENCE versus INSIGHT. The enemy must be within 20m and be able to understand your language. You cannot taunt monsters or animals. If you succeed, choose one of the following effects:  <br>- The enemy is angered and must direct their next attack at you, if at all possible.   <br>- The enemy is distracted and his next roll is modified by –1. If you roll more x than you initially needed to win, the enemy’s next roll is modified by an additional –1 for every x. | -0 / X     |
| You can **draw the attention** of everyone in 10m range to yourself for a few minutes. They stop what they are doing, and any OBSERVATION roll they make is modified negatively by -1, plus any extra successes you've rolled.

## **ANIMAL HANDLING**
Animals are either wild or tame. The ANIMAL HANDLING skill can be used in several ways, including riding an animal, commanding tame animals, discouraging wild animals from attacking, or even taming wild animals.

Animal Handling Specializations
>Rider: Riding tame animals like horses  
>Tamer: **Taming** or **discouraging** wild animals
>Whisperer: **Training** tamed animals in useful actions, and **commanding** them to take those actions.  

When riding, training, or commanding domesticated animals, the following difficulty modifiers come into effect:

Factors granting a +1 to an ANIMAL HANDLING roll:
- The task has a low risk of harm.
- You perform the task with them.

Factors leading to a -1 to an ANIMAL HANDLING roll:
- Your side is outnumbered
- The task is obviously dangerous
- Animal is already hurt
- Animal is hungry

If the Animal has not been trained in the task, the roll is further modified by the Animal Type DM and the Task Complexity DM (see below)

**Various ANIMAL HANDLING Actions**

RIDE: Any adventurer can sit on a horse or another type of mount without falling off, but more advanced maneuvers can require a skill roll. ANIMAL HANDLING: Rider replaces MOVE when you attempt difficult jumps or other maneuvers on beast back. Use the mount’s AGILITY in these cases to determine the number of Base Dice for the roll, not your EMPATHY. You can push the roll, but you run the risk of exhausting the mount.

COMMAND TAME ANIMALS: Using ANIMAL HANDLING: Whisperer, you can attempt to command a tame animal to do your bidding. If the Animal has not been trained in the task, the roll is modified by the Animal Type DM and the Task Complexity DM (see below).
+1 to ANIMAL HANDLING: Whisperer if:
- The task has a low risk of harm.
- You perform the task with them.
-1 to an ANIMAL HANDLING: Whisperer if:
- Your side is outnumbered
- The task is obviously dangerous
- Animal is already hurt
- Animal is hungry

TRAINING A TAME ANIMAL: Once an animal is tame, or already domesticated, you may train it to follow commands, simple or complex. This process is modified by the animal type, and by the complexity of the desired command/level of training. The process involves 1 modified ANIMAL HANDLING: Whisperer roll that takes 2 fewer days than the total modifier (e.g. if the training is at -7, the roll requires 5 days). You must spend at least 2 hours each day working on the training, or the process begins anew.
Failing a Training roll means the training failed to stick. You may begin again with a +2 DM. -2 DM for every BANE included in the failure. 
*Example: I have EMP 3, ANIMAL HANDLING: Whisperer 5. I want to train a falcon to follow combat orders. -7 DM, 5 days. I train 2h every day, and after 5th session, roll 3 BASE, 2 NEGATIVE. 2 banes appeared in my failure. I can begin the process again at -9 total. I should just get another falcon who doesn't hate me.*

DISCOURAGING WILD ANIMALS: When you encounter a wild animal, you can attempt to discourage it from attacking by communicating on a primal level. You must be at CLOSE range or closer, and you must be aware of the animal’s presence. Roll an opposed roll for ANIMAL HANDLING: Tamer against the animal’s STRENGTH – larger animals are harder to frighten off.  

TAME WILD ANIMALS:  Through a long period of work, you can use ANIMAL HANDLING: Tamer to tame a wild animal. The animal must be caught, and to successfully tame it you must use ANIMAL HANDLING: Tamer successfully as many times as the animal’s STRENGTH, spread out over an equal number of days. You must spend a Quarter Day (see page 144) every day taming the animal, or the process begins anew. It is possible to tame SOME non-demonic monsters. There will be a penalty ranging from -1 to -3.  

Failing a Taming roll doesn’t stop the taming process, just slows it down by a day where no progress was made. The process continues as long as you spend a Quarter Day working on it. If a failure includes a BANE, mark it as a CRITICAL FAILURE. Each time you accrue a critical failure, roll 1D6. If the roll is equal to or less than the number of CRITICAL FAILURES you have, the taming process is botched and the animal is now too traumatized to continue.
## **MEDICAL AID**
**(Advanced Skill. Requirement: Scholar: Medicine 2)**  
there is a significant risk that you and your friends will be injured, sooner or later. This is when the MEDICAL AID skill is useful. 

Medical Aid Specializations
>EMT: When restoring lost STRENGTH or AGILITY points as a Slow Action, when moving the wounded, and when reviving an unconscious person.
>Field Surgeon: When stabilizing fatal critical injuries, performing surgeries, when moving the wounded, or reviving an unconscious person.
>General Practitioner: Long-term treatment of critical injuries, treating disease, infections, and rad/bio/chem damage.  
>Veterinarian: Treating damage, injuries, and other conditions in animals.

**MEDICAL AID Actions**

REVIVE UNCONSCIOUS: If a character has been knocked unconscious by BLUNT damage to the head, they're unconscious for many minutes. A MEDICAL AID: EMT or Field Surgeon roll, or a SURVIVAL: First Aid roll (slow action) can revive an unconscious character. 

FIRST AID: A person who has had their Strength or Agility reduced to zero is Broken, and cannot act any further. If you apply your MEDICAL AID: EMT skills to them (slow action) and your roll succeeds, they get back on their feet and immediately recover a number of attribute points equal to the number of x you roll. This can also be applied to characters who are not broken, but at the very least, BANDAGES or some form of IMPROVISED EQUIPMENT are required without suffering a -3 DM. You may heal yourself with this skill at -2 DM.

MOVING THE CRITICALLY INJURED: If someone suffering from a lethal critical injury attempts to move themselves, they must make an immediate **death save**. If you want to move another person suffering from a lethal critical injury, you must make a MEDICAL AID: EMT/Field Surgeon roll (no action) – failure means the injured must make an immediate death save. When carrying another person, each running action becomes a SLOW ACTION.
> A **Death Save** is a roll for ENDURANCE. You may roll even if incapacitated, but then you cannot push the roll. If you’re not incapacitated, you can push the roll normally. If a death save fails, you die. If you succeed, you linger on, but you must make another death save when the listed amount of time has passed again.

STABILIZE FATAL CRITICAL INJURY: To stabilize a lethal critical injury and save your life, one or more MEDICAL AID: Field Surgeon (-2 DM) rolls must be made. Medical equipment can give a bonus to the roll. If you are not incapacitated, you can attempt to administer medical aid to yourself, but with a –2 modifier. The MEDICAL AID: Field Surgeon roll takes the same amount of time to perform as the time limit of your critical injury, i.e. one round, turn, or QD. (If the time limit is a round, the first aid is a slow action.) If the roll **succeeds**, the time limit of your crit is increased one category, i.e. from round to turn or from turn to QD. When a crit with a time limit of a QD is successfully treated, you no longer risk dying and you don’t need to make any further death saves. If the MEDICAL AID roll **fails**, trying again is allowed – after a death save has been made.  
> A **Death Save** is a roll for ENDURANCE. You may roll even if incapacitated, but then you cannot push the roll. If you’re not incapacitated, you can push the roll normally. If a death save fails, you die. If you succeed, you linger on, but you must make another death save when the listed amount of time has passed again.

TREAT LONG-TERM CRITICAL INJURY: Each critical injury takes a particular number of days to heal. If someone tends to you for a QD during the process of healing a critical injury and makes a MEDICAL AID: General Practitioner roll, that day counts double. If the critical injury is listed as "permanent", depending on GM's say, a QD-long MEDICAL AID: Field Surgeon (-4 DM) roll can make this a 2D6 day healing process.

TREAT DISEASE OR INFECTION: To care for someone in the course of their illness or infection, you make their "infection rolls" instead of the sufferer. The caregiver rolls for MEDICAL AID: General Practitioner modified by the virulence of the disease/infection. If provide antibiotics, the sufferer gets a +3 bonus to the roll, but it has no effect against viruses or radiation sickness.

If the character has the MOUNTED COMBAT talent and is driving/piloting, vehicle counts as the "primary weapon," and their attack with a weapon is a fast action as though they were taking their second attack action with their off-hand (secondary) weapon.

>	**Overkill**: Replace the effect of a Panic Roll of 14 or higher by the Overkill effect if you have any enemies in sight. Overkill effect: you must immediately attack your enemies and you won't stop until you or all enemies in sight are Broken. Also, all other PCs within 20m of you must make an immediate Panic roll.

>	**Fast Healer**: Healing time for critical injuries is halved

>	**Shepherd**: Anyone can use you as an Anchor when they need to relieve stress, even if you are not their Anchor.  
>	**Seen it all**: Once per session, you may ignore all rolled banes. If you do so, your acclimatization to the situation prevents you from gaining the Bane's Willpower points as well. 
>	**Signature Item**: You have a signature item- a small item that's not of much practical use, but that has sentimental value to you and that says something about your character. Signature items are usually tiny and thus don't encumber you at all. Common examples include a patch, a cap, or a photo of a loved one. Once per game session, you can interact with your signature item in some way to reduce your Stress Level by 1D6. This requires a slow action.  
>	**Wallflower:** As long as there are any two people from your party present, they may together act as an Anchor. You do not need to roll a Panic Check if any of them Panic or suffer a Critical Injury so long as there are still 2 in your party not Panicking or suffering from a Critical Injury. If you're with only 1 party member, they do not count as an Anchor, no matter who they are.

>	**Hidden Stash**: Each session you may have an extra reasonable item of your choice, hidden or stowed somewhere.

>>>		**Rank 2:** Moderate fluency. -2 from Social INSIGHT & INFLUENCE rolls in this language. No need to roll to understand basic topics. -2 SCHOLAR: Languages when trying to understand complex/technical topics.  
>>>		**Rank 3:** Full fluency. No Social INSIGHT & INFLUENCE penalties, no understanding rolls needed. 
>	**Linguist**: You know another language of your choice, well enough to be taken as native on a successful Influence roll.  (OLD)
>	**Light Sleeper**: You can go for 5 QDs without sleep instead of 3 before suffering stress  
>	**Packrat**: May carry +4 additional Weight.  
>	**Seductive:** When trying to manipulate through seduction, receive a +1 bonus. You may spend a WP to turn the bonus into 1D8, and 2 WP to turn the bonus into 1D10.  
>	**Signature Ride**: This specific vehicle is yours, and you know every bolt and cable, nook and cranny. Choose one vehicle or (not one type, but a single, specific vehicle). You receive a +1 bonus to DRIVE or PILOTING with the chosen vehicle. You may spend a WP to turn the bonus into 1D8, and 2 WP to turn the bonus into 1D10. Can be chosen multiple times for additional signature vehicles.  
>	**Stunt Driver**: Once per session, you may use one DRIVE or PILOT Bonus Effect for free without needing to roll. Must possess at least one rank in DRIVE or PILOT to be used in their respective craft. Can be chosen multiple times for additional uses but uses of this talent cannot be triggered simultaneously. However, a free DRIVE Bonus Effect can be used alongside a normal DRIVE roll for the purposes of stacking effects.  
>	**Survivalist's Calm:** You find one particular survival activity (hunting, foraging, fishing, sailing, scrounging, leading the way) relaxing. A QD spent doing that activity counts as REST. This talent may be purchased multiple times, choosing a new activity each time.   
>	**Wheel Guardian:** When your vehicle suffers critical damage, you can reroll once. The lowest roll counts.  

CHARACTER TRAITS  
>	**Sacred Vow**: You have made a vow to serve a sacred cause. Regardless of what power you serve or what your goal is, you can draw power from the vow you once made. If you make a roll for an action that is a direct consequence of your vow or that clearly leads you towards your sacred goal, you can spend a Willpower Point to gain a D8 Artifact Die to the roll, before rolling. Spending 3 WP gives you a D10 to use, and spending 5 WP gives you a D12 to use. Activating the talent doesn’t count as an action.
