# Item Supply
## Availability
Item availability indicates how easily equipment can be obtained within the metropolitan area. These codes provide general guidelines, though specific neighborhood conditions may affect an item's availability.  
1. **Common**. The item is generally available in decent quantities. Finding it will take 1D6x10 min, reduced by 1 per SCHOLAR success.  
2. **Uncommon** only in major commercial districts or through established vendors. Roll 1D6 per level of Wealth of a settlement/district (1D6 Poor, 2D6 Moderate, 3D6 Wealthy). If any dice result in a **4 or higher**, 1D6 units of the item are available. A new roll can be made each week. Finding it will take 1D6x30 min, reduced by 1 per SCHOLAR success.  
3. **Specialized item**, typically only available through specific manufacturers or specialty shops. Roll 1D6 per level of Wealth of a settlement/district (1D6 Poor, 2D6 Moderate, 3D6 Wealthy). **If any dice result in a 6**, 1 unit of the item is available. A new roll can be made each week. Finding it will take 1D6 hours, reduced by 1 per SCHOLAR success.  
4. **Rare item**, extremely difficult to obtain through any means. Roll 1D6 per level of Wealth of a settlement/district. If any dice result in a **6, roll again. A result of 5, or 6** means this item is available. A new roll can be made each week. Finding it will take 1D6 hours, reduced by 1 per SCHOLAR success.  
## Restriction
Certain items require permits to own or operate, or are limited to authorized organizations and individuals. For restricted items, a permit fee must be paid for legal ownership. A permit fee is calculated separately from the item's base cost.  
F. **Fee**, permit and/or background check commonly required for purchase.  
R. **Restricted** item typically requires special licensing such as law-enforcement or government sanction.  
X. **Illegal** for any non-millitary. Possession and use typically violates federal law except for specifically authorized personnel.  
### The Black Market
To find a restricted item without the required legal authorization, first an Availability Roll must be made. If it's available, only a successful SCHOLAR: Streetwise or INFLUENCE: Trader roll determines if you can find a seller.  
**If you fail**, roll for Mishaps: 1D6 per level of Wealth of a settlement/district (1D6 Poor, 2D6 Moderate, 3D6 Wealthy). If an X is rolled during the Mishap roll, roll 1D6 on the mishap table below, referencing Restriction Level

| Restriction Level | Scholar/Influence modifier | Mishap on failure + Mishap X. (roll 1D6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# VEHICLES
**FEATURES**  
> **Passengers:** Number of adults, including driver, that can comfortably ride vehicle  
> **Speed**: In hex-based combat, this number x10 is the number of meters vehicle can move in one Drive Action (Fast Action). During a CHASE, if driver elects to use the "Pursue / Flee" action, this number becomes DRIVE Attribute Die instead of Maneuverability.   
> **Maneuverability:**  advanced maneuvers require DRIVING rolls, which use the MANEUVERABILITY rating of the vehicle as the attribute die.   
> **Reliability**: How much damage the vehicle can take before becoming Wrecked.  
> **Armor:** Vehicle's armor, and also the armor rating of any cover the vehicle provides to passengers.
